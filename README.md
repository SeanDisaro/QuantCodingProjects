# QuantCodingProjects
Some Coding Projects to Explore some Quant Finance Methods.
We use python 3.13

These are just some fun coding projects which I do as a preparation to being a Quant.


## BlackScholesMonteCarloEuropoeanOptionPricing.ipynb
This is a notebook, where we do some Monte Carlo Black Scholes optoion pricing. We also use a variance reduction method for our monte carlo simulation, to improve the results, when we want to predict exotic europeans!

## TeslaOptionPriceGARCH.ipynb

In this notebook, we predict the volatility of the Tesla stock in advance using a GARCH model and then compare, if this gives us an edge in option pricing when using the Black Scholes formula with just the volatility at the current day.
