# QuantCodingProjects
Some Coding Projects to Explore some Quant Finance Methods.
We use python 3.13

These are just some fun coding projects which I do as a preparation to being a Quant.

## plotProbabilitesNvidia_UpDown.ipynb

This notebook explains how to translate **option prices to probabilities** on where the price of a stock will be at future times. This is used to derive **probability density functions** which illustrate how likeley it is that a stock will be under/above some price at some time. See the animatino above or the following heatmap:

## TeslaOptionPriceGARCH.ipynb

In this notebook, we **predict the volatility** of the Tesla stock in advance using a **GARCH** model trained with the **historic volatility**. This is then used to price options with Black Scholes and the Binomial tree model. We compare the values we get with the **market values** and the **implied volatility** of said options. The actual prices we predicted differ from the market prices. We assume that our prediction gives us an edge (not really but just for the sake of coding and having a little bit of fun) and we construct a Delta and Gamma Hedged portfolio with calls, puts and the underlying tesla stock.
This is then used to build a **delta hedged** portfolio.



## pe_500s&p_by_sector_industry.ipynb

This notebook **scrapes** all the **S&P500 symbols from wikipedia**, then gets the **pe ratios and industries** from yahoo finance and then checks which companies have a pe ratio which is well below (1 std deviation) under the industries mean pe ratio. This is a very basic screening which might be interesting to fundamentalists.



## BlackScholesMonteCarloEuropoeanOptionPricing.ipynb
This is a notebook, where we do some **Monte Carlo Black Scholes optoion pricing**. We also use a **variance reduction method** for our monte carlo simulation, to improve the results, when we want to predict exotic europeans!
