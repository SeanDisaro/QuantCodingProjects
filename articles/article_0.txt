		CLAUDE HAIKU 4.5: Anthropic introduced Claude Haiku 4.5, its latest small model, now available to all users. “Claude Haiku 4.5 even surpasses Claude Sonnet 4 at certain tasks, like using computers.

The scale of the project and xAI’s precarious finances are forcing the company into unusual financial arrangements that rely on outsiders to raise funding and shoulder much of the risk, the authors add. xAI wants to have as much control as possible over Colossus 2, its second supersize data center in Memphis. XAI’s desire to control its data centers is in contrast to rivals such as OpenAI and Anthropic, which have partnered more extensively with outside cloud firms to get the computing power they need, they note. The publication further highlights that xAI is working on a $20B lease-to-own deal for Nvidia (NVDA) chips, has formed joint venture with Solaris Energy for a 1-gigawatt power plant. xAI’s precarious finances force reliance on outside funding and risk-sharing, the report adds. EXEC DEPARTURE: Ke Yang, Apple’s (AAPL) executive in charge of developing an AI-driven web search is departing the company to join Meta Platforms, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported. The team he was leading, called Answer, Knowledge, and Information – or AKI – was said to be central to the major revamp planned for Apple’s Siri tool, the report stated.

It’s critical for the music industry to join forces and act together to protect creativity while enabling innovation. Stamping out the worst outcomes of Gen AI is an essential piece of the puzzle. Last month, we shared steps we’re taking to stamp out spam, impersonation, and deception in the age of AI. We’ve also been hearing consistently from artists and their teams that emerging AI music products often don’t feel like they’re built to power their careers, their businesses, and their fan bases. Too frequently, they feel like short-term experiments built to compete with them, rather than long-term solutions designed to serve artists. That’s why Spotify’s focus has been on utilizing Gen AI technology to power features that connect fans and artists, like our AI DJ, personalized daylist, or AI Playlist, which help listeners discover their next favorite artists in new ways. Today, we’re announcing plans to collaborate with Sony Music Group, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, Merlin, and Believe to develop responsible AI products that empower the artists and songwriters they represent, and connect them with the fans who support them. (We hope to bring on additional rightsholders and distributors over time.) Some voices in the tech industry believe copyright should be abolished. We don’t. Musicians’ rights matter. Copyright is essential. If the music industry doesn’t lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent, or compensation. Together with rightsholders, artists, and songwriters, we are making significant investments in AI research and product development.” Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
