Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an undisputed market mover, with an eager audience of investors closely watching its comings and goings. Its earnings report – usually among the final releases of the season – often transforms the closing stretch into a high-stakes moment for Wall Street.This time looks no different. When Nvidia reports on February 25 after the bell, expectations are running high, and the setup suggests the company could once again deliver a blowout quarter.After all, the major hyperscalers are doubling down on capex, continuing to spend money at breakneck speed. Look no further than the earnings reports of the four horsemen (Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta), which appear poised to ramp up spending from nearly $400 billion in 2025 to an astounding $700 billion in capex this year.
		Still, the market hasn’t been kind to the hyperscalers, whose spending raises concerns of both shrinking margins and potential bubbles. That’s one of the biggest reasons that NVDA has seen its share price trend sideways for much of the past six months.The big question investors should be asking themselves is whether the AI capex spigot will remain open. According to one investor, known by the pseudonym Nova Capital, that question holds the answer to Nvidia’s next major move.“Are we going to see continued investments in chips, racks, and everything related to AI over the next 2-3-5 years? The latest plans revealed by major tech companies justify a ‘yes’ to that question, in my opinion, so the secular bullish story for Nvidia is here to stay,” the investor opined.While the capex spending should be reflected in “another strong quarter” for Nvidia, the investor points out that NVDA’s lag behind the broader market has created a consolidation phase for the stock. Nova therefore expects the share price to move higher once the upcoming earnings report provides “bullish confirmation” that the company continues to benefit from the surge in AI spending.Nova isn’t too bothered by the risk of other companies (i.e., Amazon and Alphabet) moving chip production internally or shifting to other competitors, both foreign (i.e., China) and domestic (i.e., AMD). The investor posits that Nvidia’s technological offerings are just too ingrained in the AI ecosystem.
		“I think the market’s pie has become big enough to support a few more years of the firm’s fundamentals blooming, so to speak,” adds Nova.Beyond the numbers, the investor is anxious to hear management’s commentary on Rubin’s progress and China sales, and is predicting plenty of positives will emerge on the earnings call. And even if the short-term bet doesn’t play out perfectly, Nova is planning on sticking with NVDA for quite some time.“Even if the rally doesn’t occur in a short period, my medium-term projections point to a possible 12-24 months upside potential of 65%. Given that, I remain bullish on Nvidia stock ahead of earnings,” concludes Nova, who rates NVDA shares a Buy.
