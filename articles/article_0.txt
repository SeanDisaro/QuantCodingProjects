Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) plunged 17% on Wednesday even after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected Q4 2025 results. The company’s Q1 2026 guidance failed to impress investors, especially given the massive artificial intelligence (AI) spending. Let’s look at the reactions of top analysts to AMD’s Q4 performance and outlook.Following the Q4 print, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri lowered the price target for AMD stock to $310 from $330 and reiterated a Buy rating. The 5-star analyst noted that AMD stock has been outperforming rivals like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), driven by investor optimism about server strength fueling some upside in earnings per share (EPS) revisions. However, the Q4 earnings call indicated that AMD’s server CPU strength is being largely offset by a nearly $1 billion cut to the gaming business for 2026, making it frustrating for some investors looking for continued beat/raises on EPS.While Arcuri acknowledged investors’ concerns, he highlighted that fundamentals for the segments that “really drive the narrative (CPU/GPU) are headed in a positive direction.” The analyst is confident about AMD delivering EPS of more than $11 in 2027 and more than $15 in 2028. Arcuri added that although the next chance for major earnings upside may come later in the year, when MI455x production ramps up in Q4 2026, these EPS estimates should still help the stock move higher. While Arcuri remains bullish on AMD stock, he lowered his price target to reflect valuation pressure across AI peers like Nvidia and Broadcom.
		Truist Securities analyst William Stein increased the price target for AMD stock to $283 from $277 and reaffirmed a Buy rating. The 5-star analyst continues to be bullish on AMD stock, given that it is expected to grow its EPS at about 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030 and trades at only about 11x 2030 EPS. Regarding AMD’s Q4 beat, Stein noted that “65% of the revs and all of the EPS beat were from selling a written-down China SKU.” He added that AMD’s Q1 outlook shows higher operating costs, which wipes revenue and margin upside. Nonetheless, Stein highlighted that AMD reiterated a 60% data center CAGR and 35% total sales CAGR, which he believes will drive EPS of over $20 in 2030. Interestingly, strong customer engagement remains the key support for Stein’s bullish thesis. The analyst raised his 2027 EPS estimate to $10.11 from $9.25.Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon increased the price target for AMD stock to $235 from $225, while maintaining a Hold rating. The 5-star analyst noted that investors were expecting strong results, and the company delivered. But without the boost from China, the numbers were mostly just in line with expectations. On the brighter side, the analyst highlighted that server trends seem very strong, while the company continues to gain market share in the client market.However, Rasgon noted that near-term AI growth isn’t picking up much and the OpenAI ramp is still uncertain and now looks more like a Q4 story. The analyst also cautioned about potential client headwinds in the second half of the year. While Rasgon understands the need for higher spending, he thinks that AMD’s execution against its spending outlook has been “lackluster.” At the current valuation, the analyst prefers other AI names.Currently, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Advanced Micro Devices stock based on 28 Buys and eight Holds. The average AMD stock price target of $286.03 indicates 42% upside potential.
