Investors have grown used to Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) dominating growth headlines. Nvidia is still projected to deliver revenue growth of more than 58% this year, while Palantir is on track for a 45% gain. These are big numbers by any measure. But analysts are now pointing elsewhere in the S&P 500 (SPX), where four companies are expected to beat both.The names might surprise you. Expand Energy (EXE), TKO Group (TKO), EQT (EQT), and KeyCorp (KEY) are each expected to post revenue gains of 60% or more in 2025. That’s nearly 10 times the growth forecast for the S&P 500 overall, which FactSet estimates at just 6.2%. It shows that despite the AI craze, some of the fastest-moving growth stories are hiding in other corners of the market.The top spot goes to Expand Energy, an oil and gas refiner based in Oklahoma City. Analysts expect its 2025 revenue to reach $9.4 billion, a massive 215% jump from last year. High oil prices are fueling the rally. A barrel of light crude is trading near $62, well off last year’s peak but still about 14% higher than the lows.
		Despite these fundamentals, the stock hasn’t fully caught fire. Expand Energy carries an RS Rating of just 24, suggesting investors haven’t yet priced in the company’s growth story. Analysts, however, are also forecasting earnings per share to grow nearly 388% this year, which could make the stock hard to ignore if oil prices remain stubbornly high.TKO Group, the company behind WWE wrestling and UFC mixed martial arts, is another standout. Analysts forecast revenue of $4.7 billion in 2025, a 67% jump from last year. Unlike energy, TKO’s growth is tied to entertainment demand, pay-per-view events, and live shows that keep fans engaged.TKO stock’s technicals are far stronger than Expand Energy’s. With an RS Rating of 90 and an EPS Rating of 79, TKO is already drawing investor attention. If its growth trajectory continues, it could cement itself as one of the S&P 500’s most unconventional growth leaders, showing that Wall Street rewards performance even outside the traditional tech and energy plays.EQT, a natural gas producer, is on track to deliver revenue growth of about 61% in 2025. Like Expand Energy, it’s riding the wave of high commodity prices and strong global demand. Investors often shy away from the volatility of energy names, but EQT’s numbers suggest it could be one of the top performers in the index this year.KeyCorp’s story is different. As a regional bank, it doesn’t usually show up in growth lists. Yet analysts forecast a 60% revenue increase for 2025. That growth is tied to rising interest income and efforts to stabilize after a turbulent period for regional banks. If those numbers hold, KeyCorp could become one of the year’s biggest financial surprises.
		Nvidia and Palantir remain central to Wall Street’s growth narrative, but they no longer stand alone. Expand Energy, TKO Group, EQT, and KeyCorp prove that other industries can deliver growth rates that beat even the top names in AI.Investors can compare these stocks based on analyst ratings and various financial metrics on the TipRanks Stocks Comparison Tool.
