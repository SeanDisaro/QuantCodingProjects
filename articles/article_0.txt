We heard yesterday about chip stock Intel (INTC) and its plans to invest in India by hooking up with Tata Electronics. But that investment may not stop there, as evidenced by recent meetings between Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan and Narendra Modi, India’s Prime Minister. Intel investors, however, were not exactly pleased about these meetings, as shares slipped fractionally in Tuesday afternoon’s trading.Tan took meetings with Modi, reports noted, not only giving Modi praise for his work in driving artificial intelligence use in the country, but also working to set up a new policy around semiconductor design and manufacture. Tan was not there alone, however, as the CEOs of both Microsoft (MSFT) and Cognizant (CTSH) were also on hand to show their support for India’s moves to advance in chipmaking.Tan noted, “Honored to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi this afternoon. We had a wide-ranging discussion on a variety of topics related to technology, computing and the tremendous potential for India. I applaud the Prime Minister for putting in place a comprehensive semiconductor design and manufacturing policy and Intel is committed to support the India Semiconductor Mission.”
		Intel also rolled out something perhaps more immediately exciting, as reports noted a new graphics card may be coming. The card may be especially powerful, as reports note it has a thermal design power claimed to be around 300 watts. Should this claim prove true, this card would draw 33% more power than the B580 card, which is currently the best card Intel has. Reports also suggest 32 Xe2 cores, a 256-bit memory bus, and 16 gigabytes of GDDR6 memory.Moreover, reports suggest that the card in question—which is being referred to as a B770 for now—would be on par with the RX 6000 and RTX 4000 models from Nvidia (NVDA). That would likely give Intel potential room to reclaim some lost market share, especially if the pricing is attractive.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on five Buys, 24 Holds and six Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 99.9% rally in its share price over the past year, the average INTC price target of $37.04 per share implies 7.58% downside risk.See more INTC analyst ratingsDisclosure
