CoreWeave, Inc. (CRWV) faces a new legal chapter of uncertainty after a securities class action lawsuit was filed in a U.S. court in New Jersey. The suit claims the AI cloud firm misled investors about its ability to scale its data center buildout and meet strong demand for its services. The news comes three days before CoreWeave reports its fourth-quarter and end-of-the-year results on Wednesday. The case centers on claims that CoreWeave overstated its ability to deploy AI systems “at massive scale” and to “rapidly scale our operations.” In addition, the complaint alleges that the company failed to disclose key delays tied to third-party data center partners. Investors have until March 13, 2026, to seek lead plaintiff status in the case.Meanwhile, CRWV shares rose slightly on Friday, closing at $96.04. 
		CoreWeave builds and runs data centers that provide high-performance graphics chips for AI workloads. The company has positioned itself as a key partner for firms that need fast access to advanced chip power. As demand for AI surged, CoreWeave said it could meet “robust” and “unprecedented” demand due to its “competitive strengths.”However, cracks began to show late last year. On October 30, 2025, a planned merger with Core Scientific, Inc. did not win enough shareholder votes and was called off. The stock fell about 6% that day.Then on November 10, 2025, CoreWeave cut its full-year outlook for revenue, operating income, capital spending, and active power capacity. The company cited “temporary delays related to a third-party data center developer who is behind schedule.” Shares dropped more than 16% in the next session.Later, on December 15, 2025, The Wall Street Journal reported that a large data center site in Texas linked to OpenAI had been pushed back by several months. The report said the site builder had flagged delays at that location and at other sites “since at least February.” The stock fell another 3% the following day.Taken together, these events led to a sharp reset in the stock price. What had been seen as a pure AI growth story began to look more like an execution test.
		That shift matters because CoreWeave has been valued as a high-growth AI play, similar in spirit to Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) or other firms tied to AI buildout. When a stock trades at a premium, the market expects clean execution and steady growth.Now investors are weighing whether the delays were short-term issues or signs of strain in the buildout model. CoreWeave relies on outside partners to construct and power its data centers. If those partners fall behind, capacity growth slows, and revenue timing can slip.At the same time, demand for AI compute remains strong across the U.S. tech sector. Large clients continue to invest in AI tools and cloud services. As a result, some analysts may view the recent issues as growing pains rather than structural flaws. Others may wait for clearer proof that new capacity can come online on time.For now, the lawsuit adds another layer of uncertainty. Still, class actions are common after sharp stock declines. The more important signal for investors will likely come from future guidance and updates on data center progress.In short, the core issue is simple. CoreWeave built its story on speed and scale in AI infrastructure. The market will now watch closely to see if the company can deliver both.
		On the Street, Coreweave holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average CRWV stock price target is $118.57, suggesting a 23.46% upside from the current price.See more CRWV analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
