Nvidia (NVDA) heads into 2026 as the world’s most valuable company and the top supplier driving the global race to build artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. After tripling revenue over the past three years, the big question is whether Nvidia can keep its momentum going into 2026. Well, early signals suggest the company is gearing up for another blockbuster year.    Nvidia’s fiscal Q3 results, released last month, showed how strong demand remains. The company reported record revenue of $57 billion, up 62% year‑over‑year. Particularly, Data Center sales hit $51.2 billion, driven largely by its Blackwell‑generation GPUs.CEO Jensen Huang said Blackwell sales are “off the charts,” and cloud GPUs remain sold out, which shows that hyperscalers and AI startups are still racing to secure compute capacity.
		Moreover, Nvidia said it expects $65 billion in revenue next quarter, signaling that the AI boom is far from cooling.Another clear indicator of Nvidia’s strong trajectory in 2026 is its massive order pipeline. In late October, Nvidia revealed that it has a $500 billion backlog of orders for its upcoming Blackwell and Rubin chips.The order is scheduled to be filled over the next six quarters, stretching into early 2027. This strong backlog provides high visibility into Nvidia’s future revenue.Nvidia estimates that global AI data‑center spending could reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030, up from roughly $600 billion in 2025. The key driver is the massive compute required to train and run generative AI foundation models.Even if this projection proves optimistic, it reflects the scale of the opportunity ahead. With over 90% market share in data‑center GPUs, Nvidia is positioned to capture a large share of this investment.
		Further, in scenarios where competitors gain share, Nvidia’s growth rate is still expected to outpace most of the big tech companies in 2026.All signs point to Nvidia entering 2026 with powerful tailwinds: surging demand for Blackwell GPUs, accelerating data center growth, and a rapidly expanding global AI footprint.Further, some of the major factors that might influence Nvidia stock in 2026 include the production ramp-up of Blackwell Ultra, the expansion of networking technologies like NVLink and InfiniBand, rising demand for inference chips, and growing investment in sovereign AI infrastructure as more countries seek to reduce reliance on foreign compute.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on NVDA stock based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Further, the average Nvidia price target of $258.45 per share implies 43.13% upside potential.See more NVDA analyst ratings
