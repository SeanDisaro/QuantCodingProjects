ASML Holding NV (ASML) is due to report its Q4 on Wednesday, and investors are expecting big things. The company plays a quiet but vital role in the global AI chip race. The company builds machines that help print tiny chip paths onto silicon. These tools are needed to make the most advanced chips used in AI systems. As a result, demand for ASML tools continues to rise with AI growth.ASML works with all the major chipmakers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) and Intel Corporation (INTC). It also benefits from strong demand linked to Nvidia (NVDA) chips. In fact, ASML is the only maker of EUV tools used in top-tier chips. John West of Yole Group said ASML is “the only game in town” for this tech.Meanwhile, ASML shares have doubled since April and are up about 25% this month. This move reflects rising chip demand and tight supply across the market. Naturally, investors now look to ASML earnings on Wednesday, January 28, for signs of higher growth.
		Meanwhile, chip makers are raising spending plans. TSMC plans to lift capital spending by 37% to $56 billion in 2026. Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) may raise spending by 24% to $40 billion. SK Hynix could boost spending by 25% to $22 billion, while Micron Technology (MU) plans a 45% rise to $20 billion.Analysts say about 25% of chip spending goes to chip-making tools, and most of that money flows to ASML due to its market role. This share could grow as AI chips require more complex steps. Demand also comes from firms such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM).Looking ahead, ASML may also see added demand from China in 2026. Mizuho analyst Kevin Wang said he sees “China business upside” next year. Despite rivals in older tools, experts expect ASML to keep its lead. Dan Hutcheson of TechInsights said changing tools now would be too risky. He added that firms are betting large sums on ASML systems years ahead.For now, ASML remains a key link in the AI chip supply chain.According to the Street’s analysts, ASML has a Strong Buy consensus rating ahead of its earnings report. The average ASML stock price target is $1,488.64, implying a 5.33% upside from the current price.
