Trump held a tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, with the potential supply of U.S. long-range cruise missiles, Tomahawks, on the agenda. Zelenskyy walked away from the meeting not only empty-handed, but apparently upbraided by Trump, who said Ukraine should accept Russia’s terms for ending the war — by handing over the entire eastern territory of Donbas, the epicenter of ongoing fighting in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters this weekend, Trump said for Donbas to be “cut the way it is,” the author notes. “It’s cut up right now, I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia,” he said on Air Force One on Sunday. “They should stop right now at the battle lines … Go home, stop killing people and be done.”PRODUCED IN U.S.: Nvidia (NVDA) said it is working together with TSMC (TSM) to celebrate the first Nvidia Blackwell wafer produced on U.S. soil, representing that Blackwell has reached volume production. This bolsters the U.S. supply chain and onshores the AI technology stack that will turn data into intelligence and secure America’s leadership for the AI era, the company said. “This is a historic moment for several reasons. It’s the very first time in recent American history that the single most important chip is being manufactured here in the United States by the most advanced fab, by TSMC, here in the United States,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. “This is the vision of President Trump of reindustrialization – to bring back manufacturing to America, to create jobs, of course, but also, this is the single most vital manufacturing industry and the most important technology industry in the world.”
