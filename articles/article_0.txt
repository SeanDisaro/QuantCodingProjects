Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has seen some volatility recently as investors reassess AI valuations and debate whether parts of the trade had run too far, too fast. Still, sentiment remains highly reactive, with shares surging about 8% on Friday and showing that buyers are quick to step back in.After all, the broader tech landscape continues to lean in Nvidia’s favor. Several major tech players have posted solid earnings and made it clear they are not easing up on AI spending. The race to build out AI infrastructure is still accelerating, and that ongoing capex wave feeds directly into demand for advanced chips.Against that backdrop, attention is now turning to Nvidia’s upcoming fiscal fourth quarter (January quarter) results due later this month on Feb 25 – and based on recent investor conversations, Goldman Sachs analyst Jim Schneider says expectations are being shaped by exactly these sustained AI spending signals.
		“Based on our conversations, we believe expectations are high and investors are long into earnings given strong supply-side results (TSMC, SK Hynix) and demand datapoints (higher 2026 CapEx from US hyperscalers),” the 5-star analyst said.Schneider anticipates a beat-and-raise quarter, and his headline estimates are more bullish than consensus. The analyst expects Nvidia to deliver a $2 billion revenue beat in FQ4, calling for revenue of $67.34 billion versus the Street at $65.64 billion. The analyst also stands 8% above the Street for Q1 revenue, projecting $76.84 billion compared with consensus of $71.145 billion. Likewise on EPS, Schneider’s Q4 and Q1 estimates are 5% and 9% above the Street, respectively, at $1.59 versus $1.52 and $1.80 versus $1.65.That said, given that most of the potential upside for 2026 already appears reflected in the stock, Schneider thinks near-term share performance will be driven by how much clarity the market will get on 2027 revenue.Apart from the outlook for 2027, investors will also be keen to find out about “non-hyperscaler customer demand trends.” OpenAI is expected to start scaling deployments in 2H26, supported by its partnerships with Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD. While Schneider anticipates 2026 volumes to be modest relative to a roughly 26GW capacity objective over a 4–5 year period, he will be watching for early evidence of execution from OpenAI, as well as commentary from Nvidia on its visibility into those deployments. Beyond OpenAI, conditions across the broader AI ecosystem continue to look healthy, with Anthropic lifting its CY26 revenue forecast by 20%, and activity tied to sovereign deployments remaining solid.Investors are also likely to focus on competitive dynamics vs. ASICs and AMD. Google’s TPU v7 and AMD’s MI455X accelerators are expected to narrow the gap with Nvidia on raw compute performance, and the analyst also sees Microsoft’s recently announced Maia 200 as a credible alternative.
		Additionally, following recent press reports indicating that China has approved imports of Nvidia’s H200, Schneider expects investors to look for “incremental details” on the potential revenue contribution from China through 2027. Lastly, attention is likely to center on the Rubin ramp. At CES, Nvidia said Rubin is already in production and set to ramp in 2H26. Schneider expects there will be a focus on how quickly that ramp builds, with initial shipments expected in Q3 and a “very strong ramp” in Q4 and beyond.All told, Schneider gives NVDA shares a Buy rating, along with a $250 price target. Should the figure be met, investors will be pocketing returns of ~35% in a year’s time.
