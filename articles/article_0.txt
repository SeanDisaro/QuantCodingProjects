Runway AI, a private company based in New York, is best known for its video tools used in creative fields. Now it is moving into robotics and autonomous vehicle training after inbound interest from firms in those industries. The expected shift creates a new market for a company that has raised over $500 million and is valued at $3 billion. Notable investors include Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG), and General Atlantic.The timing lines up with strong growth projections. The global autonomous vehicle simulation market is valued at $1.4 billion in 2025 and is projected to reach $7.3 billion by 2034, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.4%. Additionally, the general simulation market is projected to grow from $15.1 billion in 2025 to $44.3 billion by 2034.Runway’s world models can generate video clips up to 30 seconds long and hold a consistent look across scenarios. That matters in robotics because testing in the real world is expensive and time-consuming. By using simulation, engineers can change one variable while holding the rest steady, which is hard to do in live settings.
		The company will not build new models from scratch. Instead, it will fine-tune its existing models for robotics uses and form a dedicated team for that purpose. Runway believes its background in visual generation gives it a head start in creating realistic training environments.Nvidia has also entered this space with its Cosmos world models. That sets up both competition and potential overlap since Nvidia is also a backer of Runway. Alphabet could also have an interest through its self-driving unit, Waymo. Other simulation software names like Ansys, Siemens (SIEGY), and Autodesk (ADSK) may also feel the impact as new demand builds.For now, Runway is private, so there is no direct stock trade. However, investors can watch how its shift affects listed firms with ties to simulation and robotics. The fact that Runway has support from both Nvidia and Alphabet shows how major players see long-term value in this field.In summary, Runway’s move reflects a broader trend in which generative AI is starting to shape robotics and self-driving development. For investors tracking this space, it adds another signal that simulation software is steadily emerging as a growth market.Using TipRanks’ Comparison Tool, we’ve gathered some of the notable names in the software simulation industry, along with other companies appearing in the piece.
