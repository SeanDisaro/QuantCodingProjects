Nvidia (NVDA) is back in the spotlight as it prepares to report its fourth-quarter results for FY26 on February 25. Ahead of the earnings, Oppenheimer’s five-star analyst Rick Schafer reiterated his Buy rating on NVDA. Schafer expects Nvidia to have a “typical” $2–3 billion upside to sales expectations for Q4 FY26 quarter and Q1 FY27, reaching $65.6B and $71.6B, mainly driven by the GB300 Ultra. Schafer also maintained his price target of $265 on NVDA stock, implying an upside of 40% from current levels.Overall, analysts expect Nvidia to post adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.52, up nearly 71% from the year-ago figure of $0.89. Moreover, sales are expected to jump 68% year-over-year to $65.67 billion.Schafer expects a positive Q4 report from Nvidia. He added that spending by cloud service providers is rising, with total capex expected to hit $650B in 2026, up from over $400B in 2025. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) are growing 10x per year, and the amount of reasoning tokensare increasing more than 5x.
		Amid this backdrop, Schafer believes that Nvidia’s NVL72 rack-scale system continues to lead in AI efficiency. In addition, the Vera Rubin VR200 is on track for full production in Q3, followed by the VR300 Ultra early in Q3 2027. He stated that the Vera Rubin system will likely sell for 40–50% more than the GB300, which sold for about $3.5 million. This could bring in around $8 billion in extra revenue for Nvidia.Additionally, Schafer said with China now included—a potential $50 billion market—Nvidia’s total addressable market could reach about $4 trillion. Overall, he sees NVDA as “the ubiquitous AI platform best positioned to win.”According to TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 31 Buys and one Sell assigned in the last three months.
