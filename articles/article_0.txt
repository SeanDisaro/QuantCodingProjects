U.S. Senators plan to introduce legislation on Thursday that would make it more difficult for China to obtain critical American AI-related technology, effectively barring Nvidia (NVDA) from selling its AI chips to Beijing, the Financial Times’ Demetri Sevastopulo reports. The Secure and Feasible Exports Chips Act would mandate that the commerce secretary prohibit export licenses for advanced chips to China for 30 months, which would prevent Nvidia from selling its H200 and Blackwell chips to China, the author says. Other publicly traded companies in the space include AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), Marvell (MRVL), Microchip (MCHP), Micron (MU), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Texas Instruments (TXN).Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
