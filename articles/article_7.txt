Massive spending by hyperscalers and some recently announced major deals by tech giants have reassured investors about continued demand in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Despite concerns about an AI bubble due to elevated valuations, Wall Street remains bullish on several AI stocks, driven by a robust demand backdrop. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we placed Vertiv Holdings (VRT) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) against each other to find the AI stock that has higher upside potential, according to Wall Street analysts.Vertiv Holdings offers power, cooling, and IT infrastructure solutions and services to data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial facilities. VRT stock has jumped 53% year-to-date, thanks to strong demand for the company’s AI infrastructure that is required in data centers. VRT stock soared recently after the company announced that it has significantly advanced its platform designs for the construction of 800-volt direct current (VDC) to power Nvidia’s (NVDA) 2027 rollout of Rubin Ultra platforms.Meanwhile, VRT is scheduled to announce its third-quarter earnings on October 22. Wall Street expects Vertiv to report earnings per share (EPS) of $0.98, reflecting a 29% year-over-year growth. Further, revenue is expected to rise 25% to $2.58 billion. It is worth noting that Vertiv has surpassed the Street’s earnings expectations for ten consecutive quarters. In July, VRT reported market-beating Q2 results and raised its full-year guidance.
		Ahead of the Q3 results, several analysts have raised their price targets for Vertiv Holdings stock, thanks to AI-induced tailwinds. For instance, RBC Capital analyst Deane Dray increased his price target for Vertiv stock to $191 from $162 and reaffirmed a Buy rating as part of a Q3 earnings preview for stocks in the industrials space.The 5-star analyst noted several multi-year sector drivers, such as electrification, reshoring, as well as data centers and AI. Moreover, he expects the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts to fuel continued mid-cycle growth and strong earnings visibility. Dray added that “tariffs remain a fluid but manageable headwind for now.”Overall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Vertiv Holdings stock based on 15 Buys, two Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average VRT stock price target of $170.47 indicates a 2% possible downside from current levels.See more VRT analyst ratingsChipmaker Advanced Micro Devices’ stock has rallied more than 46% over the past month and 93% year-to-date. Investors are impressed by the company’s new AI GPUs (graphics processing units) and strategic deals. Notably, AMD announced its game-changing deal with OpenAI (PC:OPAIQ) to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs over multiple years, beginning with a 1-gigawatt rollout in 2026.
		The company then announced a major partnership with Oracle (ORCL), under which Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) will deploy 50,000 AMD MI450 GPUs, starting in the second half of 2026. AMD’s new GPU offerings and these significant partnerships have boosted confidence in the company’s ability to compete with Nvidia in the AI chips race and drive higher revenue and profitability.Recently, Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson raised his price target for AMD stock to $270 from $190 and reiterated a Buy rating ahead of the company’s third-quarter results. The 5-star analyst noted that over the last quarter, AMD has provided certainty around GPU demand by signing new agreements (mainly OpenAI and Oracle deals) that would substantially boost its GPU revenues. While Bryson increased his H2 2026 data center GPU/AI estimates, he highlighted that his estimate for AMD’s total AI data center revenues in 2026 remains close to $10 billion as he expects it to take “somewhat longer” for the semiconductor company to boost its revenues. That said, for 2027, Bryson expects AMD to deliver a notable portion of a gigawatt of capacity to OpenAI, with AI-related revenues expanding to $20 billion. Even after considering higher operating expenses in the out years, Bryson significantly increased his EPS estimate for calendar year 2027 to $9.Overall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Advanced Micro Devices stock based on 30 Buys and 10 Holds. The average AMD stock price target of $250.22 indicates 7.4% upside potential.See more AMD analyst ratings
Wall Street is bullish on both Vertiv Holdings and Advanced Micro Devices stocks. However, currently, analysts see higher upside potential in AMD stock, while they see a downside risk in VRT. The demand for AMD’s AI chips appears promising based on the massive deals that the company has secured. Interestingly, according to TipRanks’ Smart Score Tool, AMD stock scores a “Perfect 10,” implying that it has the ability to outperform the broader market over the long term.
