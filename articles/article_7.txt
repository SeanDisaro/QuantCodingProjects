Alexa+ is the newest Prime benefit, building on the tremendous value members were already enjoying.” SORA 2, SOCIAL APP: OpenAI said that, “Today we’re releasing Sora 2, our flagship video and audio generation model… With Sora 2, we are jumping straight to what we think may be the GPT 3.5 moment for video… As a general purpose video-audio generation system, it is capable of creating sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism… we’re launching a new social iOS app just called “Sora,” powered by Sora 2. Inside the app, you can create, remix each other’s generations, discover new videos in a customizable Sora feed, and bring yourself or your friends in via cameos. With cameos, you can drop yourself straight into any Sora scene with remarkable fidelity after a short one-time video-and-audio recording in the app to verify your identity and capture your likeness… This app is made to be used with your friends… Protecting the wellbeing of teens is important to us. We are putting in default limits on how many generations teens can see per day in the feed, and we’re also rolling out with stricter permissions on cameos for this group. In addition to our automated safety stacks, we are scaling up teams of human moderators to quickly review cases of bullying if they arise. We are launching with Sora parental controls via ChatGPT so parents can override infinite scroll limits, turn off algorithm personalization, as well as manage direct message settings… The Sora iOS app is available to download now. You can sign up in-app for a push notification when access opens for your account. We’re starting the initial rollout in the U.S. and Canada today with the intent to quickly expand to additional countries… Sora 2 will initially be available for free, with generous limits to start so people can freely explore its capabilities, though these are still subject to compute constraints.”COPYRIGHT HOLDERS: OpenAI told studios that it plans to release a new version of Sora that creates videos featuring copyrighted material unless copyright holders opt out, The Wall Street Journal’s Keach Hagey, Berber Jin, and Ben Fritz report. The new product will require copyright holders to explicitly request that their material not be included in Sora-generated videos, according to people familiar with the matter, who add that while copyright characters will require an opt-out, the new product won’t generate images of recognizable public figures without their permission. CHATGPT CONNECTOR: UiPath (PATH) announced a collaboration with Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI to build a ChatGPT connector integrating OpenAI frontier models with enterprise customer workflows, powered by UiPath enterprise orchestration, accelerating time to value and ROI from their agentic AI efforts.
