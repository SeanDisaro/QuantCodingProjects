The Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership, or “AIP,” MGX, and BlackRock’s (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners announced they will acquire 100% of the equity in Aligned Data Centers from private infrastructure funds managed by Macquarie Asset Management and its co-invest partners. “The transaction will fuel the expansion of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure and implies an Aligned enterprise value of approximately $40B,” the consortium stated. AIP was founded by BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, a part of BlackRock, MGX, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) to expand capacity of AI infrastructure and “help shape the future of AI-driven economic growth,” the group noted. “The transaction is AIP’s first investment and an important step towards its initial target of mobilizing and deploying $30B of equity capital, with the potential of reaching $100B including debt. With Aligned’s strong customer relationships, presence in key strategic digital hubs, and proven management team, Aligned is well positioned to anchor AIP’s vision for the future of AI infrastructure. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions,” the group added.Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
