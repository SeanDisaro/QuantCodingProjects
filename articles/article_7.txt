The major averages were mixed near noon as investors prepare for next week’s Federal Reserve meeting. The recent inflation and labor data have nudged expectations even more firmly toward a rate cut, with most models pricing in a 25 basis point reduction, though a larger 50 basis point move is seen as unlikely. On the economic front, the labor market continues to show signs of softening. Jobless claims have surged, hitting multi-year highs. Looking to commodities, gold prices were trading higher near noon, continuing the commodity’s march toward $3,700. Meanwhile, oil prices surged, rebounding from yesterday’s losses.
