Artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker Cerebras Systems has secured $1 billion in its Series H funding round, bringing its post-money valuation to about $23 billion. The substantial investment, officially announced on Feb. 4, was raised to meet the rising demand for the company’s AI infrastructure and hardware solutions. Cerebras Systems’ latest $1 billion funding now positions it as a formidable competitor to industry giants like Nvidia (NVDA). The latest Series H round is a late-stage investment that signals the company is scaling rapidly as it prepares for further expansion and a possible future IPO. The funding round was led by investment firms Tiger Global Management, Benchmark, Fidelity, and others.
		Interestingly, Cerebras’ $1 billion investment follows a $1.1 billion raise just four months earlier, during which the company’s valuation nearly tripled, from $8.1 billion to $23 billion. The timing of the financing also coincides with a reported multi-year, $10 billion deal between Cerebras and OpenAI to boost its supply of AI hardware. Cerebras is widely recognized for developing one of the world’s fastest AI processors, the Wafer Scale Engine 3 (WSE-3). This processor is designed to perform AI model training and inference tasks, delivering performance more than 20 times faster than traditional GPU-based systems while consuming less power. From a financial standpoint, Cerebras has demonstrated strong growth, with revenue climbing to $136.4 million in the first half of 2024, more than 10 times what it reported in the same period the previous year. Although the AI chipmaker paused its initial public offering plans after withdrawing the filing in October 2024, the company has since reported plans to resubmit the paperwork, potentially going public in 2026.TipRanks private company page offers a closer look at Cerebras Systems and other private companies in the AI industry.
