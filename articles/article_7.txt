Nvidia (NVDA) stock was up on Wednesday alongside reports that it has increased the price of the graphics processing units (GPUs) and VRAM that it sells to graphics card manufacturers. While unconfirmed by Nvidia, insiders claim that the semiconductor company notified GPU makers of a price increase for these bundles on January 16.The latest report doesn’t include the exact price increase for Nvidia’s GPU and VRAM bundles, but it does claim that Nvidia’s price is still below what rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) charges graphics card makers for its GPU and VRAM bundles. The price increase hasn’t affected the MSRP of Nvidia cards yet, but talk from the company’s executives earlier this year suggests that consumers might see a price change sometime in 2026.Consumers have had to deal with increased PC parts prices over the past couple of months due to the ongoing RAMpocalypse. The demand for RAM has surged alongside increased demand for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. This has resulted in a shortage as more server components are needed to meet this demand, limiting what’s available to retail customers.
