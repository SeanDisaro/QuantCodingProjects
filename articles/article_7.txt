Chipmaker Nvidia’s (NVDA) shares are slightly down at the time of writing despite the launch of Earth-2, which is a new set of artificial intelligence models and tools designed to make local and global weather forecasts up to 15 days out. The release comes as a major winter storm stretches from Texas to Massachusetts. More specifically, the storm has already pushed at least 12 states to issue federal disaster declarations. It has also caused widespread power outages, delayed flights, and disrupted oil and gas production.Traditionally, weather forecasting relies on massive supercomputers running complex physics-based simulations that are expensive and slow. However, Nvidia says that Earth-2 takes a different approach by using AI models that significantly reduce computing time and costs. Because the Earth-2 models, libraries, and frameworks are open, more countries, weather agencies, and businesses can build forecasting systems that are tailored to their own needs, thereby making advanced predictions more accessible.Importantly, Earth-2 is already being used by weather agencies and businesses around the world. These include the U.S. National Weather Service, The Weather Company, Taiwan’s Central Weather Administration, and energy firms like TotalEnergies (TTE) and Eni (E). The platform also integrates open weather models from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that Google DeepMind continues to grow its own AI weather tools. This includes its WeatherNext2 model, which can generate a 15-day forecast in about one minute.
