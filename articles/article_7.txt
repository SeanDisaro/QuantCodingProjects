Quantum computing stocks cooled in 2025 after a strong early run, and many names are now well below past highs. That pullback has pushed investors to think more about the long run rather than short-term price moves. As 2026 begins, many are spreading their bets across different types of companies. Larger tech firms offer scale, funding, and deep research, while smaller pure-play names such as D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) provide more direct exposure to the technology. This mix reflects a steady approach focused on long-term progress rather than quick results.To narrow the list, we used TipRanks’ Quantum Computing Stocks page, which lets investors review stocks based on analyst ratings, price targets, and key performance indicators in one place. From that list, we selected three stocks that carry Strong Buy ratings from analysts. Each also has an Outperform Smart Score (i.e., 8, 9, or 10) on TipRanks and offers more than 30% upside based on current 12-month consensus price targets.Here are today’s top quantum computing stock picks. Click on any ticker to thoroughly research the stock before you decide whether to add it to your portfolio.
		1. Microsoft (MSFT) – Microsoft is taking a steady and patient approach to quantum computing. Instead of pushing out a chip quickly, the company is building a broad platform through Azure Quantum, which allows users to access different quantum systems through the cloud and begin testing use cases today.Microsoft is also developing a topological qubit, which it believes could be more stable and easier to scale in the long run. While this work is still early, it gives Microsoft exposure to quantum computing alongside its much larger cloud and AI businesses.MSFT stock has an analyst consensus of Strong Buy, 34.26% upside potential, and a Smart Score of eight.2. Nvidia (NVDA) – Nvidia is not building a quantum chip, but it is positioning itself as a key partner to quantum systems. The company expects quantum machines to work alongside classical computers, with GPUs handling tasks like simulation and error control.Nvidia has expanded its CUDA Quantum tools and introduced NVQLink to help connect quantum hardware with traditional systems. This gives Nvidia exposure to quantum computing as the bridge between today’s technology and what comes next.
		NVDA stock has an analyst consensus of Strong Buy, 39.15% upside potential, and a Smart Score of eight.3. D-Wave Quantum – QBTS focuses on a different approach to quantum computing through quantum annealing, which is already being tested for real-world problems. The company works with customers in areas such as logistics, supply chains, and scheduling, where its systems are used to solve complex tasks. While QBTS remains a higher-risk stock, its focus on near-term use cases gives it a more practical angle compared with many early-stage quantum peers.QBTS stock has an analyst consensus of Strong Buy, 42.20% upside potential, and a Smart Score of nine.TipRanks’ Smart Investor Newsletter provides top investment ideas on a weekly basis to help self-directed investors make informed decisions using TipRanks’ proprietary data and research.
