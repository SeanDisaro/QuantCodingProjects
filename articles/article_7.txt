Elon Musk’s xAI has received a $3 billion investment from Saudi Arabian artificial intelligence company Humain as the Middle East kingdom ramps up its aim of becoming a global AI powerhouse.The investment, announced today, was part of xAI’s $20 billion funding round back in January. It was completed shortly before the startup’s acquisition by Musk’s space exploration company, SpaceX. Humain said it became a “significant minority shareholder” in xAI as part of the deal. Its holdings will convert into SpaceX shares — a roughly 0.24% ownership in the new, combined $1.25 trillion company, according to Bloomberg.
The move is significant for xAI, which has been mired in controversy since the start of the year given the furor over sexualized images being created by its Grok chatbot. Humain and xAI announced a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia last November, along with plans for Saudi Arabia to roll out xAI’s Grok models.That will be a boost for Grok, which trails rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT in adoption and arguably profile around the world.“Together, these initiatives deepen long-term alignment and extend Humain’s role from strategic partner to leading global shareholder in xAI,” Humain said.The deal also strengthens Musk’s relationship with Saudi Arabia, which has made AI a central plank of its efforts to diversify its economy away from oil. Humain is backed by the country’s trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund, Public Investment Fund, and, according to Bloomberg, has been on a dealmaking spree to build up the infrastructure and compute capacity required to train and run AI models.Humain has previously invested in AI video-generation startup Lumai AI and has a joint venture with chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) to ramp up data center capacity in Saudi Arabia.
		Last November it also entered into a strategic partnership with Global AI, an American sovereign AI infrastructure company headquartered in New York and an Nvidia (NVDA) Cloud Partner. The partnership seeks to accelerate the expansion of AI infrastructure globally.We have rounded up the best AI stocks to buy now using our TipRanks comparison tool.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
