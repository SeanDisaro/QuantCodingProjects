American chip giant Nvidia’s stock (NVDA) continues to dominate headlines as the powerhouse behind the AI revolution, with its data center GPUs (graphics processing units) fueling record growth. After a robust 40% growth in 2025, investors face a pivotal question: will Nvidia sustain its momentum amid competition and macroeconomic headwinds, or surge to new heights on robust AI adoption? This article pits the bear case, steady but moderated gains, against the bull case of breakthrough innovations and market share expansion.On TipRanks, the lowest price target of $200 suggests 6.9% upside potential over the next twelve months. Meanwhile, the highest price target of $352 implies 88.2% upside potential. Here’s a closer look at both analysts’ views.Phillip Securities’ four-star analyst Yik Ban Chong has a Buy rating on NVDA with a price target of $200. Following Nvidia’s Q3 FY26 results, Chong raised his full year fiscal 2026 revenue forecast by 4% and profit by 10%. He attributed the faster ramp-up of the Blackwell GB300 chips, which would also boost gross margins by 0.5 percentage points.
		While Chong remains concerned about the circular nature of AI deals with OpenAI ($100 billion) and Anthropic ($10 billion), he believes they represent less than 10% of Nvidia’s $380 billion revenue visibility through the end of 2026.He sees strong, persistent organic demand from hyperscalers’ increased capex and sovereign deals in South Korea, Europe, and the UAE. Chong noted that NVDA traded at a forward P/E of 44.8x, below its historical 52.2x average.Evercore ISI’s five-star analyst Mark Lipacis also rates NVDA a Buy, with a $352 price target. He praised Nvidia’s strong Q3 FY26 earnings, which showed faster revenue growth and more product availability. He also pointed to better supply of Blackwell-based GB200 and GB300 AI platforms, with Blackwell compute revenue jumping 48% quarter-over-quarter to add over $13 billion.Nvidia reported $500 billion in data-center orders for Blackwell and advanced Rubin platforms through 2025-26. Despite tight supply concerns, Lipacis highlighted Nvidia’s 32% higher Q3 inventory and 63% jump in supply commitments to handle these orders.He views the projected $493 billion revenue for 2025-26 as conservative amid strong trends, signaling big stock upside if demand holds. His $352 price target is based on a 35x multiple on 2030 base-case EPS of $14.74, discounted back to 2026.
		Wall Street remains highly optimistic about Nvidia’s long-term outlook. On TipRanks, NVDA commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating. The average Nvidia price target of $263.44 implies 40.8% upside potential from current levels.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
