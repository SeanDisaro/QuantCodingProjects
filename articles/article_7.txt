President Donald Trump said he will raise the new global tariff from 10% to 15%, just one day after he first set the lower rate. He made the move in a social media post on Saturday, saying the increase is “effective immediately.”The shift comes after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Trump acted outside the law when he used an emergency powers act to impose broad tariffs on many trade partners. The court ruled 6 to 3 that his use of the law was not backed by the Constitution. In response, Trump first set a flat 10% tariff on foreign goods on Friday. However, by Saturday, he raised that rate to 15%. In his post, he said he will raise the tariff “to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level.”As a result, markets now face more trade risk and more policy risk at the same time. Investors also face legal risk, since the new tariff path could face fresh court action.
		This time, Trump is using Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act. That rule lets a president impose tariffs for up to 150 days without approval from Congress. However, the measure is short-term and may need support from lawmakers if it is to last longer.At first, the White House said the 10% tariff would start on Feb. 24 at 12:01 a.m. in Washington. After the change to 15%, no clear start time was shared. That lack of detail may add to market swings in the near term.Meanwhile, Trump said he will keep in place other tariffs set under Sections 301 and 232. He also ordered the U.S. trade team to launch new Section 301 probes on a fast track. Those probes require a formal review before new tariffs can be set.In addition, Trump is weighing tariffs of 15% to 30% on foreign cars. At the same time, he said goods under the U.S., Mexico, and Canada trade deal will keep their current terms.For investors, a 15% blanket tariff could raise costs for firms that rely on imports. Retail, auto, tech, and industrial names may feel the impact if input costs rise. That could affect margins and earnings in the next few quarters.
		For example, Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) rely on global supply chains. Higher import costs could affect parts and final goods, depending on how the rules are applied. Auto firms such as Ford Motor Company (F) and General Motors Company (GM) could also face cost shifts if car tariffs move to the 15% to 30% range.At the same time, the broader market may react to the legal and policy path as much as to the tariff rate itself. Investors tend to prefer clear rules. However, the rapid shift from 10% to 15% in one day adds a layer of doubt.Looking ahead, Trump will address Congress in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday. Lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns about parts of his trade plan. As a result, the next phase of this policy will likely depend on both court review and talks on Capitol Hill.We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to assemble notable stocks mentioned in the piece, which may be impacted by the planned tariffs.
