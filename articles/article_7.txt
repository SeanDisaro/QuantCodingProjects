The major averages were sharply higher near noon as the market appears to exude new optimism amid fresh signs of progress in the China‐U.S. trade dialogue and expectations of more central-bank easing. That said, commodity price swings, delayed U.S. data flows due to the government shutdown and the upcoming heavy earnings calendar continue as a counterbalance.Reports that the U.S. and China have outlined a framework deal to ease tariffs and Chinese rare-earth export controls ahead of a meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping later this week has been a key driver. Inflation and central-bank watchers are also encouraged. A slightly softer inflation print, combined with the trade optimism, boosted the odds that the Federal Reserve will cut rates at its next meeting.Looking to commodities, gold continues its sharp pullback, with the so-called “safe haven” commodity pulling below $4,000 for the first time in several weeks. Oil edged higher as the commodity continues to largely hover above the $60 mark.
