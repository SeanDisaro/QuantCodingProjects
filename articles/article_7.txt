The major averages were mixed near noon after following another slate of up-and-down earnings results. AMD shares were dropping after its quarterly report underwhelmed some analysts, while software names like Oracle and CrowdStrike were also seeing pressure. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said he had an “excellent telephone conversation” with China’s President Xi Jinping. The supposedly positive sentiment from the White House follows news yesterday that the House of Representatives voted 217-214 to pass legislation funding major parts of the government, including an extension of DHS funding, and ending a partial shutdown. Looking to commodities, gold edged higher amid a continued period of volatility for the so-called “safe haven” asset. Oil prices were fractionally lower after yesterday’s API crude data and this morning’s DOE inventory report.
