		In a Truth Social post made on Saturday, Trump warned that he would impose a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, and the UK starting February 1. The American leader added that the tariffs would then be raised further to 25% on June 1 and would remain in place until a purchase arrangement is reached on his bid to make Greenland part of the U.S.Trump has repeatedly argued that Greenland is critical to the U.S. national security. The Danish autonomous territory lies in the Arctic, bordered by the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic and located near Russia, the U.S., Canada, and Denmark.According to experts, Greenland’s rapidly warming Arctic waters could make nearby sea lanes an important future shipping corridor. The territory is also widely believed to hold significant deposits of critical minerals. However, European leaders have rejected Trump’s bid, with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen noting that “Europe won’t be blackmailed.” On his part, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called Trump’s threat “a very serious situation” but has noted that “a tariff war is in nobody’s interests.” Nonetheless, risks for global stocks remain as Trump’s new threat could jeopardize recent tentative deals reached with the European Union and the UK. Moreover, if imposed, additional tariffs would mean higher costs for automakers, industrial firms, and consumer brands that rely on the U.S. market for sales.
