Data center infrastructure company Vertiv Holdings (VRT) is scheduled to announce its results for the fourth quarter of 2025 on February 11. VRT stock has rallied 21% year-to-date and is up about 64% over the past year, driven by the demand for the company’s power and cooling solutions for data centers amid the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Ahead of Q4 earnings, Wall Street is bullish on Vertiv stock based on the company’s strong execution and robust demand for AI infrastructure.Wall Street expects Vertiv to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.29, reflecting 30.3% year-over-year growth. Revenue is projected to grow by about 23% to $2.88 billion. The company ended Q3 2025 with a strong backlog of $9.5 billion. Investors will look forward to management’s commentary about the demand backdrop and update on the backlog. Last month, Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell upgraded Vertiv Holdings to Buy from Hold and increased the price target to $200 from $181. While Barclays has not been “among the Datacenter capex theme’s biggest cheerleaders,” Mitchell noted that the recent volatility in VRT stock has created a buying opportunity. The analyst highlighted Vertiv’s revenue exposure to data centers, noting that about 80% of the company’s sales come from that end market, the highest level among U.S. multi-industry companies in its coverage.
		Mitchell noted that Vertiv’s organic sales growth has “tracked closely” with U.S. data center physical infrastructure trends and has surpassed the multi-industry average in recent years. He expects organic sales growth to remain elevated through 2026 and 2027.In early January, shares of cooling solutions providers fell after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang discussed the possibility of cooling racks with the semiconductor giant’s next-generation Rubin chips using water at a temperature that does not require a water chiller. Reacting to the statement, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani stated that while Rubin can operate at 45°C, a temperature at which inlet water potentially eliminates the need for chillers, it does not end the requirement for heat rejection units, which bodes well for Vertiv’s DX portfolio and liquid cooling components like CDUs (coolant distribution units) and SFNs (secondary fluid networks).The 5-star analyst believes that Vertiv remains well-positioned to benefit from the growing adoption of liquid-cooled architectures, thanks to solid demand for CDUs, manifolds, SFN, thermal management systems, and services. He added that as power and cooling become more integrated at the rack and facility level, Vertiv’s end-to-end capabilities across the data center infrastructure present a key competitive advantage.With nine Buys and one Hold recommendation, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Vertiv Holdings stock. The average VRT stock price target of $208.89 indicates about 7% upside potential from current levels.See more VRT analyst ratings
