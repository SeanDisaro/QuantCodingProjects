The United Kingdom and the United States have agreed on a new technology deal that links the two nations in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and nuclear energy. The plan is backed by about £31 billion, about $39 billion, in private investment from large American firms, alongside new government research efforts.First, Microsoft (MSFT) announced that it will invest £22 billion in cloud and AI projects, including building the UK’s largest AI supercomputer, which will feature more than 23,000 graphics processors. Additionally, Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) will invest £5 billion in a new data center in Hertfordshire, while continuing its research at DeepMind. CoreWeave (CRWV) plans £1.5 billion for a data center powered by renewable energy in Scotland.Nvidia (NVDA) will supply 120,000 GPUs nationwide, marking its largest rollout in Europe. Many of these chips will support the Stargate UK project with OpenAI and Microsoft. Smaller players will also gain funding, with Nvidia set to back start-ups in the UK directly.
		While AI is the largest part of the deal, quantum research is also a focus. Both governments will form a joint task force to speed up work in healthcare, defense, finance, and energy. The UK pointed to progress from Oxford Quantum Circuits and IonQ (IONQ), which already run projects with partners in both countries.Nuclear energy is another part of the plan. Officials said the deal will help cut licensing times for new reactors and add support for fusion energy research. This part of the partnership aims to improve energy security and reduce reliance on fossil fuel imports.Other firms also confirmed new funding. Salesforce (CRM) will spend £1.4 billion through 2030 on United Kingdom research. BlackRock (BLK) announced £500 million for enterprise data centers. Amazon (AMZN) and Oracle (ORCL) said they will continue with their own multi-billion-pound programs.Altogether, the UK government said the projects will create thousands of new jobs and give businesses access to more advanced AI and computing power. Officials added that the partnership should also help bring faster medical treatments and more secure energy supplies.We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to line up all the companies investing in the new wave of technological investments in the UK.
