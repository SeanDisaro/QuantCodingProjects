		CLASSIFIED NETWORKS: The Pentagon is urging leading AI companies, including Google, xAI, OpenAI and Anthropic, to deploy their models on classified military networks with fewer standard user restrictions, Reuters’ David Jeans and Deepa Seetharaman report. The goal, according to officials, is to make advanced AI tools accessible across both unclassified and classified domains to support defense applications, according to the report.AI SELF-SUFFICIENCY: Microsoft (MSFT) is planning to pursue “true self-sufficiency” in the AI space by building its own models and reducing reliance on OpenAI, Melissa Heikkila of The Financial Times reports, citing comments made by AI chief Mustafa Suleyman. According to Suleyman, this strategic shift following a restructuring of the company’s relationship with OpenAI in October, prompting Microsoft to advance its AI technology independently. IN-HOUSE AI CODING ASSISTANT: Amazon (AMZN) is directing internal teams to use its in-house AI coding assistant, Kiro, for production work, a move that has drawn criticism from roughly 1,500 employees advocating for the use of Anthropic’s Claude Code instead, Business Insider’s Eugene Kim reports. The situation highlights growing internal debate over tooling preferences and broader competition among enterprise AI coding platforms, Kim writes. BETS ON AI: As the housing market stalls, Zillow’s (ZG) CEO Jeremy Wacksman sees AI as “an ingredient rather than a threat” that can both help the company protect its turf and reinvent how people search for homes, Wired’s Steven Levy writes. Zillow is integrating AI into every aspect of its business, from the way it showcases houses to having agents automate its workflow. Meanwhile, working with a real-estate analytics company called HouseCanary, Google (GOOGL) has been experimenting in several cities with putting home listings alongside Google real estate agent ads in search. If the test works out, it’s easy to imagine that Google one day might bring the same data to AI products like Gemini, Wired says. Predictably, the Google experiment led to yet another dip in Zillow’s stock price. It also generated speculation that Google might buy Zillow, the publication adds.Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news. Try Now>>
