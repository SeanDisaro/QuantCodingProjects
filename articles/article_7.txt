The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) both track the same index — the S&P 500 (SPX). That means investors get exposure to the same large U.S. companies, including Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA), no matter which fund they choose.Using the TipRanks ETF Comparison Tool, we compared SPY and VOO to see which S&P 500 ETF may be the better choice for investors. Although the two funds hold nearly identical stocks, they serve different purposes. The SPY ETF is widely used for active trading, while the VOO ETF is typically preferred by long-term investors. Understanding this difference helps investors choose the ETF that fits their strategy. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) tracks the S&P 500 (SPX) and is designed mainly for long-term investors who want steady exposure to the U.S. stock market. Its biggest advantage is cost. VOO charges an expense ratio of 0.03%, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) charges 0.09%.
		The fee difference is small but recurring. Since SPY charges 0.09% annually and VOO charges 0.03%, investors pay about three times more in yearly costs with SPY. Over time, those extra fees reduce the returns investors keep. VOO is also one of the largest ETFs in the market, with roughly $850 billion in assets, highlighting its wide use in retirement and long-term portfolios.The fund distributes dividends quarterly and offers a slightly higher yield of 1.11% than SPY’s yield of 1.05%. For investors who plan to steadily invest and hold the S&P 500 for years rather than trade frequently, $VOO is generally viewed as the more cost-efficient option.According to TipRanks’ ETF analyst consensus, VOO carries a Moderate Buy rating, with an average price target of $756.59, implying about 18.54% upside.The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust follows the same index but serves a different role. Despite the higher fee, it dominates trading activity. On average, about 82 million shares of $SPY trade daily, compared with roughly 10 million shares for $VOO.This very high trading volume provides big liquidity, allowing investors to enter and exit positions quickly with minimal price impact. Because of that, SPY is widely used by short-term traders, hedge funds, and investors who trade options or hedge portfolios.
		In simple terms, $SPY is built for trading, while $VOO is built for long-term holding.According to TipRanks’ ETF analyst consensus, SPY also carries a Moderate Buy rating, with an average price target of $810.50, implying about 16.79% upside.Both VOO and SPY follow the same S&P 500 index, but they are used differently by investors. VOO appeals to those who want a simple, low-cost way to stay invested in the market, while SPY is favored for its heavy trading activity and ease of entering and exiting positions. The better choice depends on how you plan to use the ETF rather than what it holds.Investors looking to compare performance, fees, and income across different ETFs can use TipRanks’ ETF comparison tool.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
