Recent market volatility in U.S. stocks has led JPMorgan (JPM) to warn about “extreme crowding” in a handful of fast-rising, speculative growth names. More specifically, strategists at the bank have highlighted six stocks that they believe are especially at risk of a sharp reversal if a major macro event occurs. These include: Indeed, JPMorgan’s quant team noted that crowding in volatile and risky stocks had hit the 99th percentile, which is an extreme level that often leads to sudden selloffs. According to Bram Kaplan, the firm’s head of Americas equity derivatives strategy, these stocks are more vulnerable to shocks, while lower volatility stocks like Cigna Group (CI), Pfizer (PFE), and Verizon Communications (VZ) offer better risk-reward profiles.Interestingly, shares of Broadcom, AMD, Estee Lauder, Invesco, and Nucor have declined since December 10, with only Expedia showing a slight gain. JPMorgan calls these “second-order speculative AI beneficiaries,” which means that they are stocks investors flocked to after already bidding up names like Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT). Because these companies often rely on capital markets for growth, they’re more exposed to volatility. Still, the recent selloff might be temporary, as Micron (MU) surprised markets with strong earnings that lifted AI stocks again.
		Overall, out of the crowded stocks mentioned above, analysts think that Broadcom has the most room to run. In fact, Broadcom’s average price target of $461.93 per share implies more than 41% upside potential.See more AVGO analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
