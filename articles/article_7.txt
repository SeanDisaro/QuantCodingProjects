Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg keeps a Buy rating and $200 price target on Astera Labs (ALAB), saying today’s negative stock price reaction to the announced partnership between Amazon (AMZN) and Nvidia (NVDA) coming out of AWS re:Invent on fears that Astera’s switch opportunity could be crimped in an NVLink environment was “misplaced”.
