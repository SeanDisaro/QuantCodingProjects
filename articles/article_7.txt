Welcome to the latest update on quantum computing, where new research, industry gains, and global moves continue to shape the sector. This time, fresh ideas in encryption, a key hardware advance, and a major shift in Hong Kong’s labs highlight the range of progress.We begin at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where a team working with Los Alamos National Laboratory has developed new methods for sending secure keys. Traditional systems need ideal single-photon sources, which are costly and hard to scale. However, the group showed that protocols can still work with imperfect light.The two new methods, called truncated decoy and heralded purification, were tested with quantum dot sources. Results showed stronger performance than standard laser-based setups, with a gain of over 3 decibels. The team even built a system at room temperature and tied it to the well-known BB84 standard. The point is clear: effective quantum encryption can be achieved in more cost-effective ways and does not have to wait for flawless hardware.
		Next up, IonQ (IONQ), in partnership with Element Six, a De Beers Group company, has announced a new step with thin diamond films. These quantum-grade films can now be made using the same tools used in chip plants. In practice, that means devices once made only in labs can shift toward large-scale output.The films can bond with silicon and other standard surfaces. As a result, they enable both foundry use and the integration of diamond quantum memories with other devices on the same chip. IonQ noted that this unlocks wider applications for networking, sensing, and hybrid systems. The news builds on the firm’s Lightsynq deal, moving its photonic roadmap closer to commercial scale.Meanwhile, Hong Kong research labs have been reshaped under China’s State Key Laboratory program. Several underperforming centers closed, while two new labs now focus on quantum materials and quantum information. The move ties Hong Kong’s universities more closely to Beijing’s national tech strategy.Local funding will add about $20 million each year per lab, alongside central support. Leaders said the goal is to focus on national needs such as quantum communication and computing. The change marks a clear shift from academic-driven projects to mission-based programs with set targets.In a different turn, MOTH, a quantum technology firm dedicated to unlocking creative possibilities in art, launched Quantum Brush, an open-source art tool. The app lets users paint with quantum-driven styles based on principles like entanglement. Tested on real hardware from IQM Quantum Computers, the tool gives artists access to effects shaped by quantum rules. Although not tied to finance, it shows how quantum ideas are now reaching new areas.
