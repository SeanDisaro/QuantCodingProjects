Shares in Iren Limited (IREN), the Sydney-based AI cloud capacity provider and rival to U.S.-based CoreWeave (CRWV), tumbled over 7% on Monday. This came after CoreWeave secured $2 billion in a new five-gigawatt capacity AI factory deal with Nvidia (NVDA), the AI chip leader and the world’s most valuable company.Under the arrangement, CoreWeave will build more than 5 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030 by developing and running AI factories on Nvidia’s infrastructure, including its Rubin platform, Vera CPUs, and Bluefield‑based storage technology. In exchange, Nvidia will purchase CoreWeave’s Class A common stock for $87.20 per share.Reacting to the deal, analysts on Wall Street have hailed the extension of the collaboration between the two companies, with Raymond James calling it a “vote of confidence” in CoreWeave’s AI cloud capacity. 
		In addition, DA Davidson analyst Alex Platt sees the deal as indicating robust demand for CoreWeave’s computing capacity, while Needham argues that the arrangement is likely to come with future credit guarantees for CoreWeave to lease data center sites from third-party companies in addition to its own.Iren, alongside Amsterdam-based Nebius (NBIS), are key competitor to CoreWeave. The three companies have emerged as key go-to providers for hyperscalers, that is, Big Tech companies seeking additional AI cloud computing capacity to boost their internal base.Nonetheless, several analysts remain upbeat on Iren. For instance, H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese believes the Australian company is well-positioned for a “transformative” year. On Wall Street, Iren Limited’s shares continue to hold a Moderate Buy consensus rating. This is based on nine Buys, two Holds, and one Sell issued by 12 analysts over the past three months.In addition, the average IREN price target of $82.80 suggests about 54% growth potential.
