Apollo Global Management (APO) is nearing a deal to lend about $3.4 billion to a new investment vehicle that will buy Nvidia (NVDA) chips and lease them to Elon Musk’s xAI. According to The Information, the deal could be finalized as soon as this week. The goal is to ease some of the financial pressure as xAI spends heavily on AI data centers.This would be Apollo’s second major loan tied to xAI chip leasing. The firm made a similar $3.5 billion loan in November. Apollo is also planning to invest equity in the new vehicle, which aims to raise $5.3 billion in equity and debt.Valor Equity Partners, a longtime investor in Musk’s companies, is arranging the deal. In addition, Valor is working on a broader effort to raise $20 billion in debt and equity for AI chips that will be installed in xAI data centers.
		The financing comes as xAI continues to spend far more than it brings in. Through last fall, the company was burning more than $1 billion a month, based on financial documents cited by The Information. During the first nine months of 2025, xAI spent $7.8 billion on property and equipment as it raced to build massive data centers for its Grok AI models.Meanwhile, revenue remains limited. The company recorded nearly $210 million in revenue during the first nine months of 2025. By comparison, competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic are generating billions of dollars in revenue from their AI products.Still, Musk has been able to raise large sums. xAI said last month it raised $20 billion from investors, above its initial target. That came on top of roughly $19 billion from earlier fundraising rounds.Apollo agreed to the deal before Musk decided to merge xAI with SpaceX. The combined company is now preparing for an initial public offering that aims to raise $50 billion. Bonds issued by xAI last year have rallied since news of the merger, which has pushed down yields and improved market confidence.Overall, the deal highlights how private credit firms like Apollo are becoming key players in funding the expensive chip and data center buildout that AI companies need to keep growing.
