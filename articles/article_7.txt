Shares in ride-hailing group Uber Technologies (UBER) edged higher today after it plowed up to $500 million into a new partnership with Toronto-based autonomous vehicle startup Waabi.The Uber investment came as part of a new $1 billion funding round by Waabi, best known until now for its autonomous trucking technology.The funding consists of an oversubscribed $750 million Series C round co-led by Khosla Ventures and G2 Venture Partners and roughly $250 million in milestone-based capital from Uber to support the deployment of 25,000 or more Waabi Driver-powered robotaxis exclusively on its platform. The companies did not provide a timeline for the deployment.  
		It is understood that a further $250 million from Uber will be released later if Waabi meets specific robotaxi-expansion targets.What really got tech experts purring was the ability of Waabi to tackle both the self-driving freight and robotaxis markets simultaneously. Rivals such as Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Waymo have struggled to work on both at the same time, with Waymo closing its freight program back in 2023.“Our incredible core technology really enables, for the first time, a single solution that can do multiple verticals, and they can do them at scale,” Waabi founder, CEO Raquel Urtasun told TechCrunch. “It’s not about two programs, two stacks.”She added that the Uber deal “brings the next level of scale to the robotaxi market.”In the last five years, Waabi has launched a series of commercial pilots with a human driver in the cab in Texas. It had planned to launch a fully driverless truck on public roads by the end of 2025, but that has been delayed to sometime in the next few quarters.
		Other investors in the Series C round included NVentures, Nvidia’s (NVDA) venture capital arm, and BlackRock (BLK).Uber is certainly making a big bet on robotaxis.Earlier this year Uber, along with EV maker Lucid (LCID) and autonomous driving company Nuro, said they were working together to launch a new robotaxi program using Lucid’s Gravity SUV. The project was officially revealed at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2026) and will feature an in-cabin experience that has been designed entirely by Uber.As seen above, Uber also gets revenues from freight operations. Although not mentioned in the funding deal, Waabi’s technology could also theoretically play a role there in the future as well.On TipRanks, UBER has a Strong Buy consensus based on 30 Buy, 3 Hold and 1 Sell ratings.
