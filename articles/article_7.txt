U.S. chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is stepping up its challenge to Nvidia (NVDA) in India, the world’s fastest-growing market for artificial intelligence data centers. The California-based company has expanded its relationship with Indian IT firm Tata Consultancy Services  (NSE:TCS). The two firms are now jointly building a large-scale AI system using AMD’s Helios technology, which will supply up to 200 megawatts of capacity for businesses across India.Helios is AMD’s rack-scale AI data center platform that combines the power of the chipmaker’s newest Instinct MI455X graphics processing units, next-generation EPYC ‘Venice’ central processing units, Pensando Vulcano network interface cards, and the advanced ROCm open software for running AI workloads.
		In a statement, AMD and Tata said they “will work with hyperscalers and AI companies to accelerate data center build-outs in India.” Tata is expected to bring its enterprise expertise and scale to the table.The announcement of the expansion of the partnership between both companies coincides with the commencement of the India AI Impact Summit, which has been described as one of the world’s biggest AI summits. The new collaboration builds on the earlier partnership between both firms, which was announced in January. Both companies had joined hands to help Indian firms move beyond testing AI use cases into large-scale deployments.The partnership comes as top DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria recently raised concerns about AMD’s positioning in the AI accelerator market, especially in relation to rival Nvidia.However, AMD remains focused on strengthening its business positioning in the global chip market as the AI race continues to intensify. At the international trade show, the Consumer Electronics Show 2026, held last month, AMD showcased its Zen 5-powered Ryzen AI embedded processors.
		The company also plans to diversify its product portfolio with MI440X, a new data center chip tailored for smaller enterprises to run their AI workloads locally.On Wall Street, Advanced Micro Devices’ shares currently have a Moderate Buy consensus rating from analysts based on 24 Buys and nine Holds recommended over the past three months.However, the average AMD price target of $286.80 implies about 38% upside.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
