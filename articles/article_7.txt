Samsung Electronics’ (SSNLF) Korea-listed shares hit a new record high on Thursday. The move followed a local media report that the company is negotiating a price for its newest AI memory chip that could be up to 30% higher than the prior version. Shares rose as much as 5.4% on the Korea Exchange when trading resumed after a three-day holiday.Meanwhile, U.S.-listed Samsung stock closed 54% higher at $65.21 on Wednesday as investors reacted to rising demand for AI hardware.According to Chosun Ilbo, Samsung plans to price its next-generation high-bandwidth memory, HBM4, at about $700 per unit. This type of memory works together with AI chips inside data-center servers. Because these chips run large AI models and heavy tasks, higher prices suggest demand is still stronger than supply.
		For investors, this shows large cloud companies are still expanding AI capacity, supporting both memory makers and AI chip suppliers.Last week, Samsung said it began mass production of HBM4 and has already shipped products to customers. The move could deepen ties with major AI chip designers such as Nvidia (NVDA), which relies on fast memory to run its GPUs.The company also noted better performance. HBM4 reaches speeds of about 11.7 gigabits per second, around 22% faster than the earlier HBM3E version. Faster memory helps AI servers run more efficiently and handle bigger workloads.Samsung’s Korea-listed stock has surged this year on the back of massive chip demand fueled by the AI boom. The shares are up nearly 130%, while the OTC-listed shares have climbed more than 40% over the same period.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
