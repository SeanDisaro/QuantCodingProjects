Tech giant Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Cloud has released its new G4 virtual machines (VMs), which are built with Nvidia’s (NVDA) RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell graphics cards. These VMs are designed to handle demanding tasks like advanced AI, 3D graphics, and robotics simulations by offering a mix of high-speed processing, large GPU memory, and detailed graphics support. Notably, the G4 adds to Google’s lineup by joining the more specialized A-series and the more affordable G2 VMs. Another big update is the launch of Nvidia Omniverse as a virtual machine image on Google Cloud’s Marketplace. Interestingly, when paired with G4 VMs, Omniverse makes it easier for businesses to build detailed digital simulations, also known as digital twins, which are used in everything from engineering to robotics. In addition, to improve the performance of larger AI models, Google added a special communication system between GPUs called peer-to-peer, which boosts data sharing speed by up to 168% and cuts delays by 41%. This is especially helpful for models that are too big for one GPU and need to be split across several. G4 VMs also work with many Google Cloud tools, such as Kubernetes, Vertex AI, Dataproc, and Cloud Run, thereby helping developers train and run AI models faster.
