Nvidia’s (NVDA) earnings week is here, and Wall Street is on high alert. With the AI boom in full swing, investors are watching to see if Nvidia can keep its strong momentum or deliver another surprise. With expectations already high, Nvidia’s Q3 earnings report could influence the direction of the whole tech sector.Ahead of the report, several experts have shared their views on Nvidia’s earnings. Overall sentiment remains strong, even as some worry about a possible AI bubble.For Q3, analysts are projecting $54.8 billion in revenue, which would mark 56% year-over-year growth, powered mainly by strong demand in its data center business. The company also expects zero revenue from H20 chip sales to China in Q3 because of ongoing U.S. export restrictions on advanced AI chips. Meanwhile, Yahoo! Finance noted that ongoing restrictions on Nvidia’s ability to sell its advanced H20 AI chips to China could ‘cut several billion’ from the company’s potential revenue.
		Moreover, Wall Street expects Nvidia to post earnings of $1.25 per share for Q3 FY26, up 54% from the same quarter last year. Overall, Nvidia has beaten Wall Street earnings expectations 90% of the time over the past five years.Recently, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Nvidia could ‘move the market’ this week, depending on whether it beats expectations, raises its outlook, and shows it’s still far ahead of rivals like AMD (AMD). He further added that if the chipmaker delivers its new Vera Rubin AI chips, it could spark a strong rally in NVDA shares.For context, Vera Rubin is Nvidia’s next-gen AI superchip system, offering a major leap in compute power and memory for training and running huge, complex AI models.At the Cerebral Valley AI Summit in San Francisco last month, experts showed strong confidence in Nvidia’s future, even as debates about a possible AI bubble continued. Venture capitalists like Kleiner Perkins partner Ilya Fushman and investor Elad Gil agreed that a bubble may be forming, but they also pointed out that AI is still full of major investment opportunities.At the same time, they noted that investors are closely watching Nvidia’s new Vera Rubin chip lineup, which is expected to greatly improve data center performance. A misstep from Nvidia could shake the entire AI ecosystem, while a strong earnings report would likely boost industry confidence and lift NVDA stock.
		Overall, they estimated that Nvidia could be valued at $6 trillion by 2026.According to TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the last three months. At $242.0, the Nvidia average share price target implies a 27.25% upside potential.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
