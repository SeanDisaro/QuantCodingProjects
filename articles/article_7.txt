Cyngn (CYN) announced progress in its collaboration with Nvidia (NVDA) through the development of a simulation environment built on Nvidia Isaac Sim, an open-source robotics simulation framework, to accelerate the commercial deployment of its autonomous vehicle solutions. The environment allows Cyngn to run its autonomy and fleet management software inside a persistent, high-fidelity digital warehouse that mirrors real operational workflows, enabling faster validation and refinement of capabilities that would be impractical to reproduce at scale in physical facilities.
