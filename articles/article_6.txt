Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) didn’t become the leader in AI chips by accident – it earned that position by building hardware and software that define the standard for the industry. Today, it holds a commanding presence, with its share of the AI accelerator market estimated at more than 90%.Looking ahead, one investor, who goes by the pseudonym Hunting Alpha, believes its leading revenue indicators are “very robust.”Revenue trends at Foxconn, which supplies a major chunk of Nvidia’s AI hardware, are on the up. Moreover, Nvidia is signaling that its long-term revenue growth prospects are strong, as highlighted by a year-over-year acceleration in remaining performance obligations (RPO), particularly for net new RPOs beyond the next twelve months, which increased by $360 million sequentially. The company also anticipates generating up to $500 billion in revenue from Blackwell and next-generation Rubin chips by the end of calendar year 2026.
		However, looking at the bigger picture, Hunting Alpha thinks that competitive pressures appear to be building, and Nvidia’s leverage with customers might be slipping. One sign is the growing concentration of receivables tied to its largest cloud-service-provider customers. That share has climbed from an average of 23.8% in FY2020–2024 to 65% in Q3 FY26, suggesting Nvidia may be in a somewhat weaker bargaining position than before.Several major customers are also working to lessen their dependence on Nvidia. Microsoft is pushing its in-house Maia accelerators to replace Nvidia’s chips, while Amazon is leaning into its Trainium and Inferentia designs, which can offer 30–40% lower costs than Nvidia’s GPUs. OpenAI is exploring a custom-chip partnership with Broadcom, and Google’s TPUs now present perhaps the most serious challenge, delivering a lower total cost of ownership than Nvidia’s Blackwell chips at certain performance levels.Additionally, from a technical standpoint, when comparing Nvidia’s stock performance to the S&P 500 on relative monthly charts, Hunting Alpha is seeing signs of “bullish momentum slowing down.”So, viewed in isolation, the investor says Nvidia’s results and guide suggest its revenue momentum remains very strong. But looking at how its major customers are behaving tells a different story. For investors who are bullish on the stock, this should be a “big sign of caution,” even though Nvidia is still a generation ahead of rivals. With the current pace of innovation, however, a “generation” now lasts only about a year.From a valuation standpoint, Hunting Alpha still finds NVDA appealing, as the shares trade at an unusually attractive discount relative to peers. “However,” the investor summed up, “this plus point is arguably offset by slowing momentum in NVDA stock.”
		And with the view that Nvidia’s advantage may not last forever, the investor issues a Hold (i.e., Neutral) rating rather than a Buy. (To watch Hunting Alpha’s track record, click here)That view stands in contrast to the Street sentiment. Only one analyst shares that Neutral stance, and just one rates NVDA a Sell. The remaining 39 recent opinions are firmly bullish, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $258.10, the analysts see 41% upside over the next year.
