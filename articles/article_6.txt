Micron Technology (MU) traded higher early Thursday, extending a 10% jump from Wednesday after management provided an update on its latest AI memory chips. At an investor event, Chief Financial Officer Mark Murphy said Micron has begun shipping its newest high-bandwidth memory chips, called HBM4, to customers. The company is already in large-scale production and expects shipments to grow this quarter — about one quarter earlier than it had told investors in December.It’s important to note that HBM4 chips work alongside AI processors and help them move data quickly, making them a key part of AI servers.Murphy also said demand for this type of memory remains much higher than supply and could stay tight beyond 2026. Such supply shortages usually keep prices firm and support profit margins for memory makers.
		Micron had been seen as trailing rivals Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) and SK Hynix in bringing the newest memory to market. That raised concerns that it could miss large orders from AI chip makers such as Nvidia (NVDA).The new timeline eased those worries. Investors now see Micron as entering the AI supply chain sooner than expected, which could improve revenue growth over the next year.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on MU stock based on 27 Buys, two Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.
