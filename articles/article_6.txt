Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) are two of the most talked-about names in the AI chip race. Both companies are key suppliers for the fast-growing generative AI market, and both have now formed major partnerships with OpenAI (PC:OPAIQ). AMD’s new deal with OpenAI to supply compute hardware strengthens its position in AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, Nvidia has expanded its collaboration with OpenAI through a $100 billion investment aimed at boosting AI development and training capacity. But which stock do analysts favor now?AMD recently made headlines with its new agreement to supply 6 GW of compute hardware to OpenAI over several years. The deal links AMD with one of the biggest players in artificial intelligence and signals growing trust in its chip capabilities.After the announcement, many analysts turned more positive on the stock. Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis upgraded AMD to Buy and raised his price target to $300 from $170, calling the deal a clear show of confidence in AMD’s AI strategy and proof of stronger demand for its chips. Likewise, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri lifted his target to $265 from $210 and kept a Buy rating, saying the partnership could help AMD capture nearly one-third of the GPU market, a larger share than most had expected.
		Nvidia remains the leading name in AI computing. The company powers OpenAI’s data centers and provides chips for many large-scale AI projects. It recently expanded its partnership with OpenAI through a $100 billion investment aimed at boosting AI infrastructure and model training. With its strong lineup of GPUs, CUDA software, and networking systems, Nvidia continues to hold a clear edge over its rivals.Analysts also remain upbeat about Nvidia’s outlook. Barclays analyst Thomas O’Malley kept his Buy rating and raised his price target from $170 to $200, seeing about 9% upside. O’Malley called Nvidia’s deal with OpenAI a “compute bonanza,” pointing to huge growth potential in AI workloads. Similarly, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated his Buy rating and increased his price target from $214 to $225, suggesting about 22% upside. He described Nvidia as a “Top Pick,” noting its position as the key player in AI technology.Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we compared AMD and NVDA to see which AI stock analysts currently favor.
