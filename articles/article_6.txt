Cloud computing giant Amazon Web Services (AMZN) said on Wednesday that it’s expanding its partnership with Saudi Arabian AI company Humain. Together, they plan to install up to 150,000 accelerators—including Nvidia (NVDA) GB300 GPUs and Amazon’s Trainium processors—in a new data center called the “AI Zone” in Riyadh. As part of the agreement, AWS will also become Humain’s preferred AI partner. Tanuja Randery, an executive at AWS, called the move a major step forward in the relationship with Humain. She explained that they’re building a top-tier innovation center by combining Humain’s local expertise with AWS’ AI tools, which include Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Quick Suite, and hardware partnerships with Nvidia. In addition, this AI Zone will support customers in Saudi Arabia and around the world and expand the availability of advanced AI technologies.Notably, Humain CEO Tareq Amin said that the AI Zone is just the beginning of a much larger project that will involve multi-gigawatt infrastructure. He noted that the setup is designed to meet both Saudi Arabia’s goals and the growing worldwide demand for AI. What makes this partnership unique, according to Amin, is its large scale and the innovative way that the companies are working together. He added that the collaboration introduces a new commercial model that will help AI projects grow and reach global markets more easily.
