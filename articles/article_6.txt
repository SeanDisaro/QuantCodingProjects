Shares of British chip designer Arm (ARM) are up on Wednesday after new filings showed that chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has fully exited its stake in the company. Notably, at the end of the third quarter, Nvidia owned about 1.1 million Arm shares worth roughly $155.8 million, but a Tuesday SEC filing confirmed that the position had been sold. Originally, Nvidia was part of a group of strategic investors that collectively bought $735 million worth of Arm shares during its 2023 Nasdaq debut.That IPO investment followed Nvidia’s failed attempt to acquire Arm outright for $40 billion in 2020 from SoftBank (SFTBF). In fact, the deal collapsed in 2022 after facing regulatory opposition in both the U.S. and Europe. Despite selling its equity stake, Nvidia’s relationship with Arm remains intact. After the takeover fell through, Nvidia retained its 20-year Arm license, with CEO Jensen Huang stating that the company would remain a long-term partner. Indeed, Nvidia’s Grace CPUs, which it positions as a foundation for next-generation data centers, are built using Arm’s chip architecture.At the same time, Arm is continuing to grow on its own. In its latest quarter, revenue increased by 26% from a year ago to $1.24 billion, which was higher than analysts expected. Interestingly, Morgan Stanley (MS) said the results showed that there is strong momentum tied to AI demand, and that the company is spending more money to support future growth. While the stock slipped slightly after earnings because of cautious guidance, shares are still up 16% this year, and Morgan Stanley kept a Buy rating with a $135 price target.
		Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on ARM stock based on 18 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average ARM price target of $159.50 per share implies 23.4% upside potential.See more ARM analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
