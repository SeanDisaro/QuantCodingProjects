Nvidia (NVDA) capped off 2025 as the undisputed leader of the AI boom, but Wall Street believes the rally may not be over yet. After a massive run driven by explosive data center demand and record-breaking earnings, analysts are growing increasingly confident that NVDA still has meaningful upside ahead. On average, Wall Street analysts see the stock climbing another 40% in 2026, fueled by strong AI demand and Nvidia’s growing leadership in high-performance computing.Here’s why top analysts are still bullish on NVDA.Last week, five-star analyst C.J. Muse at Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated his Buy rating and $300 price target on NVDA, implying nearly 60% upside from current levels. Muse noted that while AI-related stocks have faced pressure from risk-off sentiment and bubble fears, he believes the market is overlooking the bigger opportunity. He sees these concerns as exaggerated and points to a new wave of AI demand emerging.
		With next-generation architectures on the horizon, improved visibility into demand, and valuations adjusting, Muse views Nvidia as increasingly attractive heading into 2026, naming it a “top pick.”Earlier this month, Tigress Financial’s top-rated analyst Ivan Feinseth raised the price target for NVDA from $280 to $350 and maintained a Buy rating. The firm calls Nvidia a “must-own core holding” for AI investors. Feinseth says Nvidia’s GPUs, networking, and full software stack have become the standard for AI training and inference across cloud, enterprise, and government data centers.The new price target implies a potential gain of over 85% from current levels over the next 12 months.Bank of America laid out a bullish outlook for semiconductor spending in 2026. BofA’s five-star analyst Vivek Arya projects global chip sales to jump about 30%, reaching $1 trillion—a milestone previously expected only by 2030.Arya has set a $275 price target for Nvidia, implying roughly 56% upside. Arya notes that the stock trades at attractive multiples relative to its growth, supported by strong free cash flow and several near-term growth catalysts on the horizon. He highlighted that the biggest positive for Nvidia is its strong confidence in future demand. The company has visibility into at least $500 billion in potential sales from its Blackwell and Rubin chips, along with networking products, through 2025 and 2026.
