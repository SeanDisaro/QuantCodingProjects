Despite a bloody week for tech stocks and crypto, U.S. stocks ended the week on a high note as investors weighed earnings results and fresh moves in AI spending. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose 1.68% to $50,115.67, the S&P 500 (SPX) rose 1.42% to $6,932.30, and the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) rose 1.68% to $25,075.77. At the same time, the 10-year Treasury yield eased to about 4.21%, while oil (CM:CL) closed at $63.54 a barrel and gold (CM:XAUUSD) dipped to $4,968.85.The biggest market story of the week came from Amazon (AMZN), which posted a fourth-quarter earnings miss even as revenue came in ahead of estimates. Shares fell sharply after the report, as the company also guided that 2026 capital spending could reach about $200 billion, driven by AWS AI growth. However, that same spending plan lifted many AI-linked stocks, since investors viewed it as a strong signal of long-term demand. As a result, Nvidia Corporation (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO) all moved higher as the AI trade returned.At the same time, crypto markets stayed in focus after Bitcoin (BTC-USD) slid below $70,000 and hit a 15 month low. The token is now down about 44% from its October peak, and the sharp swings also pulled crypto-tied stocks lower at points during the week. Still, some rebound followed, which helped drive large moves in names like Strategy (MSTR).
		Turning to company news, Stellantis N.V. (STLA) sank after announcing a €22 billion charge tied to its pullback in electric vehicle plans.

This came as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman criticized Anthropic’s Super Bowl ad push, calling the message “dishonest,” showing how AI rivalry is heating up.In health care, Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) rose after the FDA issued a warning on “illegal copycat drugs,” which helped support leading weight loss names.In airlines, several stocks climbed as oil prices fell and U.S.-Iran talks raised hopes for supply relief.

(DAL), and United Airlines Holdings (UAL) were among the movers.Finally, banks stayed constructive on gold, as UBS Group AG (UBS) and Goldman Sachs Group (GS) reiterated bullish views even after sharp swings in metals.
