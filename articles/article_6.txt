Singapore is forming a national space agency as it looks to secure a role in a fast-growing global space market. The National Space Agency of Singapore will be created on April 1, according to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The agency will aim to attract space companies from around the world while also setting rules for space activity. At first glance, the move may seem modest. However, the goal is not to build rockets or compete with launch firms. Instead, Singapore is positioning itself as a hub for space services, data use, and business support.This, of course, could become good news for several satellite companies’ top lines and bottom lines, including Planet Labs PBC (PL), BlackSky Technology Inc. (BKSY), Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), to name a few.This approach aligns with a broader trend in the space economy. The World Economic Forum estimates the sector could reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, up from $630 billion in 2023. That growth is driven by demand for communication, navigation, and Earth data, the group said. As a result, value is shifting away from launches and toward data, software, and processing.
		Singapore already operates three Earth observation satellites and may expand that group. Since 2022, the government has committed $165 million to space projects. Still, the real impact may come from what happens on the ground. More satellites mean more data. More data requires more processing and analysis. This creates demand for firms that supply tools rather than hardware.In satellite data, companies such as Planet Labs and BlackSky Technology focus on turning imagery into actionable insights. Their services depend on growing satellite networks and steady data flow. In space-based communication, Viasat Inc. (VSAT) and Iridium Communications Inc. (IRDM) support global links for data and voice. These networks benefit as more systems move into orbit.The trend also supports chip makers that power data handling. AMD and NVIDIA supply chips used in data centers and edge systems. Their tools help process large image sets used in Earth analysis. Other suppliers such as ON Semiconductor Corporation (ON) and Analog Devices Inc. (ADI) also play a role in signal control.The space agency also fits into Singapore’s wider economic review. The government is updating its long-term growth plan amid global tension and tech change. AI, quantum research, clean energy, and space are all part of that review. Officials said the new roadmap will be published by mid-year. In a statement, the ministry noted the space economy is being fueled by demand for space-enabled services.Singapore is not trying to dominate space. Instead, it is building a stable base that supports firms already active in public markets. Over time, that approach may quietly reinforce demand across the space data and compute ecosystem.
