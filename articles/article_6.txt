Nick Evans, a Polar Capital fund manager, is warning that many software stocks may still face big risks from AI. Evans, who runs a $12 billion global tech fund, said the threat is growing fast. “We think application software faces an existential threat from AI,” he explained.Evans has sold nearly all of his holdings in the application software space. That includes SAP SE (SAP), ServiceNow (NOW), Adobe (ADBE), and HubSpot (HUBS). He said his fund will not return to those names, as AI tools are becoming strong enough to copy and reshape much of today’s software.In simple terms, the worry is that companies may no longer need to buy as many costly software packages. Instead, firms could build their own tools using AI coding systems, while new AI startups may also enter the market. As Evans noted, AI models are “getting dramatically more powerful,” which adds more doubt around long-term value.
		At the same time, Evans has shifted his focus toward areas that benefit more directly from AI demand. His fund is now heavily tilted toward chips, with Nvidia (NVDA) as a top holding. Other semiconductor names have also gained, while software shares have fallen.Still, Evans does see some software areas as less exposed. He has increased positions in infrastructure software firms that support core systems. These include Cloudflare (NET) and Snowflake (SNOW). In addition, Datadog (DDOG) and Fastly (FSLY) have shown stronger demand, as the need for internet and data plumbing continues to rise.Evans also holds a small position and call options in Microsoft (MSFT), which he views as more durable in an AI-driven world. Meanwhile, he remains neutral on cybersecurity names, suggesting firms like Palo Alto Networks (PANW), CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), and Fortinet (FTNT) may not face the same direct pressure yet.Overall, Evans believes only a handful of software firms will make it through the shakeout. He warned that investors should stay “significantly underweight application software” and move quickly, since disruption is accelerating as AI tools improve.We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to assemble all the tickers mentioned in the piece.
