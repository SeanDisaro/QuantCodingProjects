As we head into 2026, Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) remain two of the most closely watched names in the AI hardware market. Both are expanding fast, but recent developments — from regulatory changes to new chip launches and major AI infrastructure deals — show that each company is moving forward with a different set of strengths and challenges. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we compared Nvidia and AMD to see which chip stock offers the better upside potential based on Wall Street’s latest outlook.With a market cap of $4.51 trillion, chip giant Nvidia has established itself as the dominant player in the AI GPU (graphics processing unit) market, with the stock up 37% year-to-date. The company generated $57 billion in the last reported third quarter, with $51 billion coming from data center sales alone, reflecting rapid adoption of its Blackwell platform. Demand is strong enough that lead times remain tight heading into the launch of the next-generation Rubin platform in 2026.A key recent development is the Biden-to-Trump policy transition, which included the new approval allowing Nvidia to resume shipments of modified AI chips to China. This reverses part of last year’s export restrictions and reopens a major market for enterprise AI accelerators. Analysts see this as a potential multi-billion-dollar boost over the next two years, though the exact timing depends on customer orders and logistics.
		Nvidia’s software edge also remains intact. CUDA adoption continues to grow, providing a deep ecosystem advantage that competitors cannot easily match.After the President approved Nvidia’s return to the China market, top Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon reaffirmed his Outperform rating and $275 price target. Rasgon said the H200 should appeal much more to Chinese buyers than the restricted H20, which was held back by performance limits that made local chips look stronger by comparison. The H200 is a standard Hopper chip with full capabilities. He estimates that every $10 billion in AI revenue adds about $0.25 to Nvidia’s earnings before the U.S. applies its 25% fee. Even after the fee, he still sees solid upside for the stock.Similarly, top Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers kept his Overweight rating and $265 price target. He said Nvidia could regain $25–$30 billion in annual revenue now that it can sell the H200 into China again.Currently, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Nvidia stock based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell recommendation. The average NVDA stock price target of $258 indicates 40% upside potential. AMD has made measurable progress in narrowing the gap with Nvidia. With a market cap of $359.98 billion, the stock has gained 83% so far this year. The company’s next-generation accelerators, including MI325 and MI350, aim to deliver stronger performance-per-watt and improved inference speeds. These chips are scheduled to support deployments in large cloud environments, and early testing has drawn positive feedback from hyperscalers.
		One of the most significant updates this year was AMD’s long-term deal with OpenAI (PC:OPAIQ), which includes plans for large-scale GPU deployments beginning in 2026. The agreement could translate into meaningful recurring demand once systems move into full production. AMD also continues to improve its ROCm software stack, which is critical for wider developer adoption.While AMD’s AI revenues are still much smaller than Nvidia’s, analysts note that the company is winning more design discussions than in past cycles, suggesting broader traction as new chips roll out.Recently, Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold resumed coverage on Advanced Micro Devices stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $377. The 5-star analyst said AMD remains a key supplier of CPUs, APUs, and GPUs and highlighted new deals with OpenAI and HUMAIN, which he values at about $15 billion in 2026 and more than 2 GW in 2027. Looking ahead, Leopold expects AMD to keep gaining share in the server and PC market.Currently, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on Advanced Micro Devices stock based on 28 Buys and 10 Holds. The average AMD stock price target of $284.16 indicates 28.34% upside potential.Based on scale, ecosystem lock-in, and renewed access to China, Nvidia remains the clear leader heading into 2026. Its data center business is significantly larger, and its software moat continues to anchor customer loyalty.
		AMD, however, is in its strongest competitive position in years. The OpenAI partnership, upcoming AI accelerators, and improving software tools position it as the most credible challenger to Nvidia’s dominance. The key question for AMD is execution, specifically, converting interest into wide deployment across major cloud providers.For now, Nvidia leads the AI race, but AMD’s momentum suggests a more competitive landscape as both companies prepare for major product launches in 2026.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
