The major averages were higher near noon as traders brace for the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming rate decision. Sentiment remains cautious after recent volatility in global bonds and a sharp yield spike. Many investors have parked money in safer, liquid assets as money-market funds saw a significant inflow. Meanwhile, there remains some optimism, particularly as Nvidia was on the rise as markets cheered news that its H200 AI chips got approval for exports to China, helping fuel modest gains in chip and semiconductor peers as well. That said, with the Fed meeting just ahead, many traders seem to be in “wait-and-see” mode. Volatility could emerge sharply depending on the tone of the decision and forward guidance. Looking to commodities, gold was fractionally higher following yesterday’s dip, as the “safe haven” asset inches toward the $4,300 threshold. Meanwhile, oil was roughly 1% lower near noon ahead of this afternoon’s API crude numbers.
