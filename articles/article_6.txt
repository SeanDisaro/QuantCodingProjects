Shares in U.S. tech titans including Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) were stronger today as President Trump gets ready to shield them from his new set of AI chip tariffs.According to an article in the Financial Times, the Trump administration is mulling over whether to allow companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google (GOOGL) to avoid some of its chip import tariffs if they are used in their U.S.-based AI infrastructure projects.It is reported that the so-called ‘Big Tech carve-out’ would be administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and be linked to investment commitments made by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). The contract chip maker, the world’s largest, is investing around $165 billion in new semiconductor fabrication plants in Arizona.
		The company is planning to construct three chip plants on U.S. soil, including a facility in Arizona that aims to manufacture chips using its bleeding-edge 2-nanometer process by 2028.The hyperscaler tech firms are similarly investing billions of dollars in AI-focused data centers. These require high-level chips to train and deploy large language models and other advanced applications.However, according to the article, the carve-out is not a done deal. The administration’s plans are described as ‘fluid’ and have not yet been signed off by the President.What is clear is the administration’s determination to reduce its dependence on Asian chip manufacturing hubs and bring more chip production back to the States. The U.S. said last month that it was imposing a 25% tariff on imports of certain advanced semiconductors including the H200 AI processors made by Nvidia (NVDA) in Taiwan. Reportedly, Trump may also announce new tariffs in the near future.This fits in well with Trump’s America First strategy and in its power tussle with China over which nation will come out on top in the AI race.
