Nvidia (NVDA) Chief Executive Jensen Huang said he believes OpenAI will rise to the level of a multi-trillion-dollar firm. He commented after Nvidia announced a plan to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a broad data center buildout. According to Huang, OpenAI is seeing two layers of fast growth. First, it is adding users at a rapid pace. Second, its models are demanding more computing power with each release.In his view, this mix of expanding demand and rising compute needs will support OpenAI’s move to a size usually reserved for hyperscale firms such as Alphabet (GOOGL) or Meta Platforms (META). The agreement between the two companies will start with an initial $10 billion deployment of Nvidia systems. More will follow as OpenAI adds each new stage of capacity.Meanwhile, OpenAI has launched its largest campaign yet for ChatGPT. The ads are now live on television, streaming, outdoor sites, and social media in both the U.S. and the UK. The campaign highlights simple everyday uses of ChatGPT, like planning trips or finding recipes, rather than showing the tool as a broad science leap.
		With over 700 million weekly active users, OpenAI is now trying to show how ChatGPT fits into daily life. The push also arrives as the company searches for ways to build more revenue from its fast-growing user base. OpenAI reported annualized revenue of $13 billion in 2025, a sharp increase from $4 billion the previous year. Yet, the vast majority of its users are still on the free tier.Together, these moves underline the scale of OpenAI’s growth plans. On one side, it is running a new consumer drive to reach more users in a personal way. On the other hand, it is linking with Nvidia to lock in the computing strength needed to keep its models moving forward.As OpenAI remains a private company, let’s examine its new partner, Nvidia. The chip giant continues to hold the Street’s endorsement with a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA price target is $212.33, implying a 19.16% upside from the current price.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
