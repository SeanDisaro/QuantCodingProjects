Fears about an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble and AI disrupting some industries, including software, have weighed on tech stocks in recent trading sessions. However, Wall Street remains bullish on several data center infrastructure stocks, thanks to solid demand for products and services required to run data centers and high spending by major hyperscalers. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we pitted Vertiv Holdings (VRT), Applied Digital (APLD), and GE Vernova (GEV) against each other to find the AI infrastructure stock that has the highest upside potential, according to Wall Street analysts.Vertiv Holdings provides power and cooling solutions to data centers. The company recently reported stellar Q4 2025 results, driven by strong demand for the company’s AI infrastructure. In particular, Vertiv reported 252% year-over-year growth in its Q4 2025 organic orders.Despite significant pipeline conversion to orders in Q4 2025, Vertiv expects continued momentum in 2026, fueled by strength in the data center market. The company expects organic net sales to grow in the range of 27% to 29% in 2026, with adjusted EPS growth of 42% to 45%.
		Following the Q4 results, TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias increased the price target for Vertiv stock to $269 from $211 and reiterated a Buy rating. The 4-star analyst noted the impressive jump in the company’s Q4 2025 orders. Bearing in mind the solid data center demand in the U.S., Elias continues to see upside for Vertiv through 2026. His firm’s checks indicate continued “positive price-cost,” enhanced margins, and solid near-term order volumes, provided the company continues to enhance its capacity.Elias views VRT as his “Best Idea” for 2026 based on the robust demand backdrop. The analyst highlighted that despite the large conversion of orders in Q4 2025, management expects continued growth, driven mainly by the demand in the Americas.With 14 Buys and one Hold recommendation, Vertiv stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average VRT stock price target of $280.15 indicates about 15% upside potential. VRT stock has risen about 51% year-to-date.See more VRT analyst ratings.Applied Digital builds and operates high-performance, sustainably engineered data centers and colocation services for AI, cloud, networking, and blockchain workloads. APLD stock has rallied more than 185% over the past year amid strong demand for AI data centers and growing lease revenue from operating data centers.
		The company reported a 250% year-over-year surge in its Q2 FY26 revenue. Moreover, Applied Digital reported a narrower-than-expected loss of $0.07 per share for Q2 FY26. It is worth noting that Applied Digital has signed lease agreements with CoreWeave (CRWV) for 400 MW of capacity at Polaris Forge 1, representing about $11 billion of prospective lease revenue, and another deal with a U.S. based investment-grade hyperscaler for 200 MW at Polaris Forge 2, representing $5 billion of prospective lease revenue.Recently, Applied Digital stock plunged after a 13F filing revealed that Nvidia (NVDA) offloaded 7.7 million APLD shares. Roth Capital analyst Darren Aftahi noted that Nvidia purchased these shares at $3 in September 2024 when APLD needed cash. Aftahi stated that he remains bullish on APLD stock, and “would use this weakness to accumulate as there is no operational reason NVDA needs to be an APLD shareholder, other than a nice-to-have.”In fact, the 4-star analyst stated that his firm would be “aggressive buyers” if APLD stock drops into the $20s. Aftahi noted that a lot has changed since Nvidia invested in APLD in 2024. Notably, APLD has signed two colocation leases, one with CoreWeave and another with a hyperscaler, and the analyst expects the company to announce a third lease soon. Aftahi views the news of the sale of shares by Nvidia as a headline risk and not as any fundamental change in Applied Digital’s story. Overall, APLD remains one of Roth Capital’s top picks.With 10 unanimous Buys, Applied Digital stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average APLD stock price target of $52.22 indicates about 80% upside potential.See more APLD analyst ratings.
		GE Vernova stock has risen 131% over the past year and is up 27% year-to-date, thanks to solid demand for the company’s gas turbines to power data centers. Given the robust demand and constrained supply, customers have been signing slot reservation agreements (SRAs) to secure future availability.In Q4 2025, GE Vernova’s gas power equipment backlog increased year-over-year from 33 GW to 40 GW, while SRAs increased from 29 GW to 43 GW. Aside from the Power division, the company’s Electrification segment is also benefiting from strong demand for grid and data center equipment, from both traditional companies and hyperscalers.Earlier this month, Baird analyst Ben Kallo upgraded GE Vernova to Buy from Hold and increased the price target to $923 from $701. The analyst said that just about a month after he downgraded GEV stock to Hold, he is upgrading it back to Buy, as he believes that the ongoing energy infrastructure cycle is still in its early phase and GEV is well-positioned as one of the biggest beneficiaries.Kallo explained that previously, he was concerned about overcapacity in the market for gas power following a series of announcements by rivals. However, recent checks have led him to realize that such competitive concerns will not materialize in the near- to intermediate-term.Overall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on GE Vernova stock based on 20 Buys and four Hold recommendations. The average GEV stock price target of $851.48 indicates 2.6% upside potential.
