Wall Street has started to cheer chipmaker Nvidia’s (NVDA) ai-factory-buildout">new $2 billion deal with AI cloud provider CoreWeave (CRWV). While Raymond James called it a “vote of confidence” in CoreWeave’s AI cloud capacity, Needham sees future credit guarantees from Nvidia for CoreWeave’s future leases for high-performance computing (HPC).As part of the deal, CoreWeave is tasked with developing over 5 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030 by developing and operating AI factories using Nvidia’s infrastructure, such as the Rubin platform, the Vera CPUs, and the Bluefield technology for storage systems. In return, Nvidia has agreed to buy Class A common shares in CoreWeave at $87.20 per share.The deal comes at a time when CoreWeave is battling pressure from investors despite topping Wall Street estimates in its Q3 2025 earnings results. Investors have dragged the Neocloud company to court over project delays in its AI infrastructure buildout, despite a recent update on the removal of the delay identified earlier. 
		Commenting, Needham emphasized how securing future leases from HPC operators had become difficult for CoreWeave due to concerns about its financial base and competition for hyperscaler deals, and how the deal could change that. CoreWeave builds and owns its data centers, but also leases additional sites from HPC operators.“On the [sell-side analyst] call back [with CoreWeave], it became clear that NVIDIA would look to offer a backstop or credit guarantee on future leases to make CoreWeave more competitive with investment-grade hyperscalers,” Needham clarified.Chipping in, DA Davidson analyst Alex Platt noted that CoreWeave continues to enjoy strong demand for its computing capacity, with the deal helping to ease concerns about CoreWeave’s vulnerability to third-party risks that have factored into its shares. In addition, Platt sees “multiple de-risking pathways” in 2026 for the New Jersey-based company.He raised his CRWV price target by 62% from $68 per share to $110 and elevated the shares from Hold to Buy.Meanwhile, Raymond James estimates Nvidia could earn between $60–$90 billion from selling systems and networking to CoreWeave between 2026 and 2030, representing about 40% of revenue from the deal, plus $9–$13 billion in graphics processing unit sales per gigawatt.
		In addition, the financial services firm contended that Nvidia has a strong strategic reason to cultivate an ecosystem of independent customers and partners that rely on its chips to make its business less vulnerable to big cloud providers or hyperscalers that are building and using their own in-house AI accelerators.Across Wall Street, CoreWeave’s shares remain a Moderate Buy based on analysts’ consensus rating. This breaks down to 13 Buys and 12 Holds issued over the past three months.However, the average CRWV price target of $123.86 implies about 22% growth potential.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
