Nvidia (NVDA) is currently holding its ground at $176.77, as the semiconductor titan moves to dismantle “bubble” anxieties with a massive strategic acquisition and bullish new growth forecasts. While the stock has dipped nearly 3% over the last month, strategists at UBS are dismissing fears of an investment collapse, projecting that global AI capital expenditure will surge to $571 billion by 2026.To solidify its dominance beyond hardware, Nvidia announced the acquisition of SchedMD, the developer behind the critical open-source software Slurm, which manages workloads for over half of the world’s top 100 supercomputers. This move effectively integrates Nvidia deeper into the infrastructure layer of generative AI. This ensures that its GPUs remain the undisputed backbone for foundation model developers and enterprise AI builders alike.The battle for AI supremacy is shifting from simple chatbots to massive industrial and enterprise use cases, a transition that UBS believes could lead to a $3.1 trillion revenue potential by 2030. While competitors like Broadcom (AVGO) have tumbled 16% in a single week, Nvidia’s relative strength is bolstered by the launch of its Nemotron 3 family of open AI models, which are designed to power the next generation of “agentic” AI systems.
		Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS (UBS) Global Wealth Management, notes that there is zero evidence of a “circular financing” bubble reminiscent of the dot-com era, as Nvidia’s recent partnerships account for only 10% of its projected 2026 earnings. By acquiring SchedMD, Nvidia is owning the orchestration layer that prevents GPUs from sitting idle, a “must-have” capability for companies aiming to hit the 1 million trips per week threshold in the robo-taxi and robotics races.Despite recent volatility, Nvidia (NVDA) maintains a commanding “Strong Buy” consensus among Wall Street analysts, with 39 out of 41 ratings issued in the last three months suggesting a Buy. The average 12-month NVDA price target stands at an aggressive $258.97, representing a potential upside of 48% from the last reported price.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
