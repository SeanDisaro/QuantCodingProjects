Private equity firm Apollo Global Management (APO) is close to finalizing a $3.4 billion loan to an investment vehicle that will buy Nvidia (NVDA) chips and lease them to Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, which recently merged with SpaceX. According to The Information, this would be Apollo’s second large financing deal tied to xAI, following a similar $3.5 billion loan made in November. Apollo also plans to invest equity in the vehicle, which is aiming to raise $5.3 billion in total debt and equity. Overall, the structure allows xAI to access critical AI hardware without paying the full cost upfront.The deal, which could be finalized as soon as this week, is meant to reduce some of the financial strain on xAI as Musk pushes forward with plans to build some of the world’s largest AI data centers. Notably, it is being arranged by Valor Equity Partners, a long-time Musk backer, as part of a plan to raise $20 billion for AI chips and infrastructure. Nevertheless, the need for this type of financing highlights just how cash-intensive xAI has become. During the first nine months of 2025, the company was burning more than $1 billion per month and spent $7.8 billion on property and equipment to build data centers for its Grok AI models. By comparison, rivals like Anthropic and OpenAI generated billions in revenue, while xAI recorded only $210 million over the same period. In addition, Apollo’s loan is expected to carry a 9.5% interest rate, and Valor has told investors that annual returns could exceed 22% under favorable scenarios.
