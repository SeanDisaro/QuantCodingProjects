Nvidia (NVDA) Chief Executive Jensen Huang will visit South Korea later this month to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit. The event runs from October 28 to 31 and brings together global business leaders and policymakers. During the visit, Huang plans to meet senior executives from Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) and SK Hynix, two of the world’s largest memory chip makers.The meetings come at a time when Nvidia is working to secure its supply of advanced chips used in AI data centers. Samsung and SK Hynix both produce high-performance memory, which helps power Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs. Although neither company commented on the visit, investors will watch for signs of new supply or research agreements.Meanwhile, NVDA shares rose a modest 0.78% yesterday, closing at $183.22. 
		The visit highlights closer cooperation between U.S. and South Korean chipmakers. Seoul is investing roughly $470 billion to expand its semiconductor industry, aiming to reduce reliance on overseas suppliers. For Nvidia, deeper ties in South Korea could help the company balance risks linked to trade limits on sales to China.Meanwhile, the trip takes place alongside broader discussions between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea around the same time. Talks could touch on trade rules that affect chip exports and technology sharing. Huang’s presence at the summit puts Nvidia at the center of these regional discussions, where trade and innovation often overlap.As AI expands across industries, Nvidia’s collaboration with key memory suppliers is becoming more important. South Korea’s role in chip production offers a stable base for the company’s future GPU releases and helps protect the company from supply shocks. The outcomes of this visit may also guide how chipmakers and governments plan future cooperation on AI growth.Overall, Huang’s visit underlines Nvidia’s effort to strengthen its position in Asia while staying aligned with U.S. trade policy. The company’s talks with Samsung and SK Hynix show how major players are linking strategy, supply, and policy to support the next phase of global AI development.Nvidia continues to hold the Street’s endorsement with a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA price target is $225.29, implying a 22.96% upside from the current price.
