Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) isn’t the world’s top EV seller anymore. That title now belongs to China’s BYD, which overtook Tesla on sales volume in 2025. Falling deliveries at Tesla have been well known for a while, but that hasn’t really shaken investor confidence. Instead, the focus has shifted to what’s next – AI, autonomy, and Full Self-Driving – with many betting that this is where Tesla ultimately pulls ahead.But that confidence may be getting tested.At CES, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) made the case that the next major leap in AI won’t be confined to data centers. Instead, autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots took center stage, with much of the attention landing on Alpamayo – Nvidia’s vision-language-action model that, while first unveiled in October 2025, received its biggest spotlight during the keynote.
		Alpamayo is built to tackle the “long tail” of autonomous driving – the rare, unpredictable real-world scenarios that are hard to train for but often determine whether a system is truly safe and reliable. To support that push, Nvidia paired the model with AlpaSim, an open-source autonomous vehicle simulation platform, and Physical AI Open Datasets featuring more than 1,700 hours of driving data, all aimed at helping automakers move closer to scalable, reasoning-based autonomy. Nvidia also used the stage to highlight Isaac GR00T N1.6, a reasoning-focused vision-language-action model designed specifically for humanoid robots.“Understandably,” says Morgan Stanley’s Andrew Percoco, “the focus on AV and Alpamayo created some concern around TSLA’s FSD/robotaxi competitive moat. That said, we believe Tesla is years ahead of competitors when it comes to autonomy with a clear data and scale advantage.”Percoco, who’s ranked among the top 3% on Wall Street, thinks Nvidia’s autonomous driving tech stack provides auto OEMs with a “capital efficient” pathway into more advanced autonomy, which for many could help narrow the gap in remaining competitive as L2+/L3 capabilities become a “standard consumer expectation.”But while Nvidia’s solutions could enable OEMs to jump-start their autonomy initiatives, the time required to build out a complete AV stack and integrate it into a production vehicle – including packaging, power, sensors, mounting, time synchronization, and safety validation, as well as reaching acceptable cost levels – is likely to span years rather than months. “None of this materially changes our Tesla outlook,” says Percoco, “as our base case already embeds widespread L2+/FSD equivalent adoption across the industry over the next 10+ years. NVIDIA’s product offering simply arms more OEMs with a faster follower strategy.”
		As for humanoids, Nvidia’s stack could “significantly shorten” early-stage training cycles, but real-world deployment constraints – including integration, cost, industrial validation, and manufacturing – “remain the gating factor,” areas where Tesla likely continues to hold an advantage.Bottom line, there’s no change to Percoco’s Equal-weight (i.e., Neutral) rating on TSLA shares, nor to his $425 price target, which sits 4% below the current share price.

Going by the $405.94 average price target, shares will be changing hands at a ~9% discount a year from now.
