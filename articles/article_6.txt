AMD stock surged 8.8% on the news yesterday.   Meta is investing in 6 gigawatts of computing power from AMD, valued at about $100 billion over five years. First shipments of custom MI450 GPUs and Venice CPUs will arrive in the second half of 2026. Meta also receives warrants for up to 160 million AMD shares, tying their success together. The news prompted Wall Street analysts to update their models and forecasts.  Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis raised his price target from $328 to a new Street-high of $358, implying 67.4% upside potential.

		Similarly, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh maintained his Buy rating, while lifting his price target from $300 to $330, implying 54.3% upside potential. Despite investor concerns over potential equity dilution from issuing new shares to Meta, Vinh views this capital raise as a resourceful strategy to secure Meta’s commitment and resources toward developing applications on AMD’s emerging AI computing platform.Meanwhile, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis kept his Buy rating and $300 price target, suggesting 40.3% upside. Curtis highlighted that Meta’s deal includes 1GW of special MI450X chips starting shipment in late 2026, with larger volumes in 2027. He noted that Wall Street has “already baked in some of the upside,” but the deal builds trust in AMD’s AI plans and its path to a $20 per share profit roadmap.Analysts remain cautiously optimistic about AMD’s long-term prospects. On TipRanks, AMD has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buys and eight Hold ratings. The average Advanced Micro Devices price target of $285.07 implies 33.3% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year, AMD shares have surged over 105%.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
