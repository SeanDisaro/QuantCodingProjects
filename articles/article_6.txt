CoreWeave (CRWV), a leader in AI cloud infrastructure, experienced a near 30% stock pullback over five trading days after lowering its 2025 revenue outlook during the latest earnings call. Though the company reported strong results, it now projects $5.1 billion in revenue for 2025, down from $5.25 billion, due to delays at a key data center and compute supply constraints. Despite this pullback, CoreWeave’s shares remain up over 108% year-to-date, supported by strong demand for AI computing and new long-term contracts with major tech clients. Most analysts still see a strong long-term outlook, though some have grown cautious in the short term. With the guidance cut now priced in, analysts are weighing in on what comes next. Following the print, Compass Point analyst Michael Donovan initiated coverage on CoreWeave with a Buy rating and a $150 price target. He said that though the company only went public in March 2025, it has already locked in major long-term demand. CoreWeave reported a backlog of $55.6 billion in Q3, up 85% from the prior quarter. That backlog includes large multi-year deals such as $22.4 billion from OpenAI and a $14.2 billion contract with Meta (META) running through 2031.
		Donovan also pointed to Nvidia’s (NVDA) support as a key strength. Nvidia owns about 7% of CoreWeave and agreed to a $6.3 billion capacity guarantee to make sure unused GPUs still generate revenue through 2032. Donovan said these contracts give strong visibility and support steady growth over the next several years.On the other hand, J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Murphy took a more cautious tone. He downgraded the stock from Buy to Hold, while keeping his $110 target, which suggests only a small upside from current levels. Murphy said some CoreWeave projects faced delays due to supply issues, which pushed some revenue into later quarters.Still, he noted the company continues to win new customers, including CrowdStrike (CRWD), Rakuten, Poolside, and Jasper, indicating that demand for AI cloud services remains strong.The stock of CoreWeave has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 26 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 13 Buy, 12 Hold, and one Sell recommendation assigned in the last three months. The average CRWV price target of $146.17 implies 88.95% upside from current levels.Read more analyst ratings on CRWV stock
