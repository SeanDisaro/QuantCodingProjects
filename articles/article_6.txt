Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are in focus as both chipmakers get ready to report fourth-quarter earnings. Intel shares have bounced back strongly, supported by major deals such as its partnership with Nvidia (NVDA), while AMD heads into earnings with more consistent results and a clearer outlook. Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool, we look at which of these two stocks Wall Street favors ahead of their Q4 earnings. With chip stocks under close watch, investors will be looking to earnings and guidance for clues on demand, costs, and how each company is set up for 2026.Intel stock has risen about 116% in 2025, helped by improving investor sentiment, major deals such as its partnership with Nvidia (NVDA), and progress on its 18A chip process. The rally also reflects optimism around Intel’s turnaround efforts, including cost cuts and a growing push into foundry services. However, with rivals still ahead in advanced chips, investors will look to upcoming earnings for clearer signs that recent gains can hold.
		Looking ahead, Intel is set to report its fourth quarter fiscal 2025 results after the market close on Thursday, January 22. Analysts expect earnings of $0.08 per share, down 38.5% from the year-ago quarter, and revenues of about $13.40 billion, reflecting a 6% year-over-year decrease.Ahead of the report, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis raised his price target on Intel to $45 from $40 but kept a Hold rating. The 5-star analyst said server demand is picking up, but Intel is facing tight production capacity as it shifts output away from low-end PCs toward server products. He also expects the PC market to weaken from March, pressured by higher memory costs and rising prices. On the downside, Curtis warned that margins could come under pressure as Intel ramps up new chips such as Lunar Lake and its 18A process.AMD stock has climbed more than 90% over the past year, driven by strong interest in its AI chips and a series of key partnerships. These include a deal with OpenAI and a new 10-year agreement with Riot Platforms (RIOT), which highlights long-term demand for AMD’s hardware. The company is also gaining share in CPUs and continues to push growth with new AI chip launches and upcoming products, as it builds out its position in the AI market.Looking ahead, AMD will report its Q4 FY25 earnings on Tuesday, February 3, after the market close. Analysts expect earnings of $1.31 per share, up 20% from a year ago, and revenue of about $9.63 billion, reflecting a 26% year-over-year increase.Ahead of its earnings, top KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh upgraded AMD from Sector Weight to Overweight and raised his price target to $270, citing strong demand from data center and cloud customers. He also lifted earnings forecasts to $4.01 per share for 2025 and $7.93 for 2026. While cloud processor deployments were flat month over month and memory shortages continue to cloud some end markets, Vinh sees AMD as a key winner from long-term growth in cloud and AI spending.
		Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, analysts are more bullish on AMD, which carries a Strong Buy rating and an average price target implying about 22.5% upside. In contrast, Intel holds a Hold rating, with its average price target pointing to around 7.6% downside, reflecting a more cautious view from Wall Street.Overall, Wall Street sentiment clearly favors AMD over INTC heading into earnings. Analysts see AMD as better positioned for growth, supported by stronger demand trends and a more positive outlook. Intel’s recent rally reflects turnaround hopes, but expectations remain cautious as investors look for clearer proof on execution.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
