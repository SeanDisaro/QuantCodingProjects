Nvidia (NVDA) is moving back into the consumer laptop market, and the timing is notable as the company reports earnings on Feb. 25. While Nvidia is now known for its AI chips in data centers, it is preparing to launch new processors for laptops made by Dell Technologies (DELL), Lenovo Group (LNVGY), and HP (HPQ) later this year. We’re talking about 150 million laptops sold each year.Importantly, Nvidia is not counting on this move to drive major profit right away. Instead, the company appears focused on staying close to everyday users as more devices become AI-enabled.As Jason Tsai of Digitimes said, “This isn’t just about supplying certain chips or making better parts. Instead, this is about Nvidia becoming more integrated into the next-generation PC ecosystem.” That view highlights the broader goal, which is long-term presence rather than short-term sales.
		Meanwhile, NVDA shares rose 1.02% on Friday, closing at $189.82. The new Nvidia chips are built as system-on-a-chip devices. In simple terms, that means the main processor and the graphics unit are combined into a single unit. This design is common in smartphones, including Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone, but it is still new in most Windows laptops.By combining these parts, Nvidia and its partners aim to build laptops that are thinner and lighter, while still offering long battery life and strong graphics. Jensen Huang described the chip as “low power but very powerful,” which signals the balance the company is trying to strike.There are two main efforts. First, Nvidia is working with MediaTek on a chip built on ARM (ARM) technology. People familiar with the supply chain say the first models could arrive in the first half of this year. Dell and Lenovo are among the PC makers preparing systems with this design.Second, Nvidia is also working with Intel (INTC), which still controls about 70% of the Windows PC chip market. In that case, Intel’s central processor would be paired closely with Nvidia’s graphics and AI tools.
		Meanwhile, the MediaTek version faces one key test. ARM-based Windows PCs have had issues running some high-end games. In 2024, Microsoft (MSFT) rolled out AI PCs using Arm designs from Qualcomm (QCOM), and many gamers said their favorite titles did not run well. If Nvidia can solve that problem, it could win over a group of buyers willing to pay more for performance.Although laptop sales do not match the scale of Nvidia’s data center business, they are still meaningful. About 150 million laptops are sold each year. Huang noted last year that “There’s an entire segment of the market where the CPU and GPU are integrated,” and that it has been “largely unaddressed by Nvidia today.”At the same time, pricing will be important. Analysts say laptops built around Nvidia’s new chip likely need to fall in the $1,000 to $1,500 range to avoid becoming a niche product.On the Street, Nvidia indeed has a Strong Buy consensus view, based on 31 analysts’ ratings. The average NVDA stock price target is $266.23, implying a 40.25% upside from the current price. See more NVDA analyst ratings
