The dramatic rise in capital spending across the so-called Magnificent 7 (Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA)) may be a warning sign for investors, according to Mark Hawtin of Liontrust Asset Management (GB:LIO). In an interview with CNBC, Hawtin explained that recent earnings calls showed just how aggressively these tech giants plan to spend. While the goal is long-term growth, this surge in capital expenditures could increase risk and potentially cause these stocks to underperform the broader market.Amazon is a clear example of the issue. Hawtin noted that the company is expected to generate about $60 billion in cash flow this year, but rising capital spending could consume nearly all of it. In other words, once those investments are made, very little free cash flow may be left for shareholders. Because of this, investors are being asked to trade short-term certainty for future potential, which makes these companies harder to value. On top of that, Hawtin pointed to a growing mismatch between how much is being spent on AI and how much revenue AI is actually generating today. That gap adds another layer of uncertainty. Still, he believes that one factor will ultimately separate the winners from the rest: proprietary data. In fact, he highlighted Alphabet’s (GOOGL) strong rebound last year, which was largely thanks to its deep data advantages. 
		Turning to Wall Street, out of the Magnificent 7 stocks mentioned above, analysts think that Microsoft stock has the most room to run. In fact, Microsoft’s average price target of $593.38 per share implies 42.5% upside potential. See more MSFT analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
