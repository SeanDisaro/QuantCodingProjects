Catch up on the top artificial intelligence news and commentary by Wall Street analysts on publicly traded companies in the space with this daily recap compiled by The Fly. H200 AI CHIP PURCHASES: China has tightened restrictions on Nvidia’s (NVDA) H200 AI chips, telling some tech companies approvals will be granted only in limited cases such as university R&D, signaling a harder stance on reopening the market to Nvidia, The Information’s Qianer Liu reports. Officials are also considering conditions that would require purchases of domestic AI chips alongside any limited H200 access. The directive comes a month after President Donald Trump said he would allow Nvidia to sell the H200 chip to China. AI RACE ABROAD: Microsoft (MSFT) has warned that U.S. AI companies are falling behind Chinese rivals abroad, as China leverages low-cost open models and substantial state subsidies, the Financial Times’ Cristina Criddle reports. Rapid adoption of DeepSeek’s technology in emerging markets like Africa highlights the global competitive pressure facing American firms, Microsoft President Brad Smith tells the FT. “We have to recognize that right now, unlike a year ago, China has an open-source model, and increasingly more than one, that is competitive,” he said. “They benefit from subsidization by the Chinese government. They benefit from subsidies that enable to basically undercut American companies based on price.”

This commits us to the concrete steps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our datacenters. It reflects our sense of civic responsibility as well as a broad and long-term view of what it will take to run a successful AI infrastructure business. In short, we will set a high bar.” AI -POWERED SHOPPING: Wayfair (W) is a foundational partner that co-developed Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Universal Commerce Protocol, an open standard designed to enable more seamless, secure interactions between AI agents and retailers’ platforms. “Wayfair is investing in AI-powered discovery wherever our customers are-whether that is on our own app or across external AI platforms,” said Fiona Tan, Wayfair’s chief technology officer. “The Universal Commerce Protocol serves as the common language for this new ecosystem.
