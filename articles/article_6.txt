Quantum computing drew strong interest earlier this year, but attention has since faded. With prices pulling back, long-term investors may now find a better entry point in a few select stocks. Even so, the technology itself is still at an early stage. Most experts do not expect quantum systems to show wide, real-world benefits until later in the decade. Given the long timeline, investors may prefer to spread exposure across established companies and smaller, higher-risk quantum pure plays.With 2026 approaching, investors are starting to look beyond short-term hype and focus on which quantum names could be best positioned for the next phase of development.To narrow the list, we used TipRanks’ Quantum Computing Stocks page, which lets investors review stocks based on analyst ratings, price targets, and key performance indicators in one place. From that list, we selected three stocks that carry Strong Buy ratings from analysts. Each also has an Outperform Smart Score (i.e., 8, 9, or 10) on TipRanks and offers more than 35% upside based on current 12-month consensus price targets.
		Here are today’s top quantum computing stock picks. Click on any ticker to thoroughly research the stock before you decide whether to add it to your portfolio.1. IonQ (IONQ) – IonQ is one of the few pure-play quantum computing stocks working toward real use cases. The company focuses on trapped-ion systems, which favor accuracy over speed, helping cut errors in calculations. IonQ has reported leading accuracy levels and is working with partners to test real‑world uses, such as logistics and optimization, as it moves toward larger-capacity quantum machines.IONQ stock has an analyst consensus of Strong Buy, 65.02% upside potential, and a Smart Score of nine.2. Nvidia (NVDA) – Nvidia is not building a quantum chip, but it is positioning itself as a key partner to quantum systems. The company expects quantum machines to work alongside classical computers, with GPUs handling tasks like simulation and error control.Nvidia has expanded its CUDA Quantum tools and introduced NVQLink to help connect quantum hardware with traditional systems. This gives Nvidia exposure to quantum computing as the bridge between today’s technology and what comes next.
		NVDA stock has an analyst consensus of Strong Buy, 38.34% upside potential, and a Smart Score of nine.3. D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) – QBTS focuses on a different path in quantum computing through quantum annealing, which is already being tested for real-world problems. The company works with customers in areas such as logistics, supply chains, and scheduling, where its systems are used to solve complex tasks. While QBTS remains a higher-risk stock, its focus on near-term use cases gives it a more practical angle compared with many early-stage quantum peers.QBTS stock has an analyst consensus of Strong Buy, 58.17% upside potential, and a Smart Score of “Perfect 10.”TipRanks’ Smart Investor Newsletter provides top investment ideas on a weekly basis to help self-directed investors make informed decisions using TipRanks’ proprietary data and research.
