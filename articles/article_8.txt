Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock was up on Tuesday alongside a report from Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu that Meta Platforms (META) intends to purchase MI455X artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators from the CPU and GPU maker. The report claimed that Meta Platforms will switch to AMD MI455X chips as the social media and AI company scales back its in-house ASIC plans.Meta Platforms is among the AI companies that have been working on own custom silicon to avoid reliance on Nvidia (NVDA) products. However, that appears to have hit a snag with its desire to acquire GPUs from AMD. The same report also noted that Meta Platforms chose AMD’s MI455X over Google’s TPUs for its upcoming deployments, rejecting previous rumors that Meta Platforms would acquire its new AI processors from the Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary.It makes sense that Meta Platforms would choose AMD as its main source for AI chips. Meta and AMD already have a close relationship, with Meta being the semiconductor company’s top AI accelerator customer in 2025, making up roughly 42% of its AI GPU sales. Ongoing support for AMD AI chips from a major player like Meta Platforms is a positive sign for AMD stock.
