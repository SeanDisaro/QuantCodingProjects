Hut 8 Corp (HUT) skyrocketed over 17% in pre-market trading after the company decided to officially break away from the “pure-play” miner pack. Hut 8 has secured a massive 15-year, $7 billion lease to transform its River Bend campus in Louisiana into a high-performance AI powerhouse. The deal, announced Wednesday, involves leasing 245 megawatts (MW) of capacity to infrastructure provider Fluidstack, with AI darling Anthropic (PC:ANTPQ) serving as the primary tenant. In a move that sent shares surging 25% in premarket trading, Google (GOOGL) has stepped in as a financial backstop, guaranteeing lease payments and pass-through obligations for the entire 15-year base term.The “River Bend” transaction marks the largest infrastructure bridge ever built between a crypto-native firm and a Big Tech hyperscaler. While the initial contract is valued at $7 billion, the agreement includes three 5-year renewal options that could balloon the total value to a staggering $17.7 billion. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot described the deal as the result of “disciplined, patient execution,” as the company shifts its focus from the volatile rewards of Bitcoin mining to the steady, high-margin revenue of AI data center hosting.The defining feature of this deal is the “institutional shield” provided by Google. By acting as a financial backstop for Fluidstack, Google has effectively “de-risked” the project for Wall Street’s biggest lenders. J.P. Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) are expected to underwrite a 85% loan-to-cost (LTC) construction facility, allowing Hut 8 to build out the campus with minimal upfront capital.
		“River Bend demonstrates how, when Hut 8 brings together innovative thinking… it translates into real, enduring value,” stated Noah Wintroub, Global Chairman of Investment Banking at J.P. Morgan. This financing model allows Hut 8 to generate an expected average annual net operating income (NOI) of $454 million, a massive “alchemy” for a company that was previously dependent on the price of Bitcoin for survival.The Hut 8 deal follows a “land grab” pattern seen earlier this year with Core Scientific’s (CORZ) $8.7 billion hosting agreement with CoreWeave (CRWV). As AI developers race to deploy Nvidia hardware, access to high-voltage power and cooling systems has become the rarest commodity in tech. Hut 8’s River Bend site is strategically located adjacent to Entergy’s nuclear generating station, providing the kind of reliable, carbon-free energy that hyperscalers like Google and Anthropic demand for 24/7 compute.Initial construction at River Bend is already underway, with the first data hall scheduled to go live in Q2 2027. However, the upside potential extends far beyond the initial 245 MW; the agreement grants Fluidstack a right of first offer for up to an additional 1,000 MW of capacity as the campus scales. For investors, the “River Bend” deal confirms that the “Bitcoin Miner” label is dead, Hut 8 is now an energy infrastructure play defending a multi-billion dollar stake in the AI future.Turning to TipRanks, analyst data shows Wall Street remains firmly optimistic about Hut 8 (HUT).
