U.S. stocks ended the week higher, even as sharp moves in individual names kept traders on edge. The S&P 500 (SPX) rose 0.69%, the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) gained 0.87%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) added 0.47%. The 10-year Treasury yield edged up to 4.09%. At the same time, gold (CM:XAUUSD) climbed 1.69% to $5,121, oil (CM:CL) slipped to $66.47 a barrel, and Bitcoin (BTC-USD) held near $67,966.Even so, the calm at the index level hides large swings below the surface. The S&P 500 has traded in one of its tightest ranges to start a year since the 1960s. Yet more than one-fifth of its stocks have moved up or down by over 20% so far this year. According to Citadel Securities, the gap between single-stock moves and the broad index is now at an extreme level. As Scott Rubner put it, “Single stock dispersion is at extreme levels.”Trade policy returned to the forefront. President Donald Trump said he would raise the global tariff rate to 15%, up from 10%, after the Supreme Court struck down the legal base for earlier tariffs. The move follows the use of Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows short-term import limits. Trump wrote that he was raising the rate to the “fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level.”
		Markets first rose on hopes that trade risk might ease after the court ruling. However, the shift to a 15% rate adds fresh doubt. Analysts said the move may limit a rush of exports to the U.S. during the short window of lower tariffs. At the same time, about $142 billion in tariff revenue now sits in doubt, and firms are seeking refunds.Meanwhile, AI remains a key theme. Investors continue to weigh the impact of large AI spending plans from mega-cap tech firms. Combined AI capital spending from major players is set to reach about $660 billion this year, up about 60% from last year. That has raised concern about returns and margin pressure.As a result, the so-called Magnificent Seven group has fallen about 5.6% since early January, even as seven of the 11 S&P sectors have moved higher. Venu Krishna of Barclays noted “violent rotations” as funds shift from tech into areas like consumer goods. In the same vein, Michael O’Rourke of JonesTrading said this is “a stock picker’s market, but not in a conventional sense,” adding that stock picking is now about “avoiding implosions.”Turning to single names, NVIDIA (NVDA) led gains among mega caps as traders looked ahead to its earnings report next week. Broadcom (AVGO) and Oracle (ORCL) are also set to report, keeping focus on AI demand beyond chipmakers.Elsewhere, Tesla (TSLA) faced legal news after a federal judge upheld a $243 million jury verdict tied to a fatal 2019 crash involving its self-driving mode. A jury had found Tesla 33% at fault and awarded $200 million in punitive damages. Tesla is expected to appeal.
		In the private markets, Blue Owl Capital (OWL) said it would return 30% of investor capital from a retail credit fund after selling $1.4 billion in loans. The move comes as parts of the private credit space face higher redemption pressure.In media, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) received a seven-day waiver to revisit a hostile bid for Paramount Global (PSKY), while Netflix (NFLX) continues to pursue its own studio deal amid regulatory review.In energy, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and peers watched oil markets as analysts warned that a possible U.S. strike on Iran could disrupt supply through the Strait of Hormuz. For now, most expect limited action, but the risk remains on watch.At the same time, Meta Platforms (META) faced a youth-safety trial in Los Angeles, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg testifying on claims that the company’s social media harms children. The case adds to ongoing legal and policy pressure on large tech firms.Looking ahead, investors will watch NVIDIA earnings closely, as the company remains a key signal for AI demand. In addition, markets will track any new guidance from the White House on tariffs and sector-specific trade probes under Sections 301 and 232.
		Finally, traders will keep an eye on macro data and bond yields, especially after fourth-quarter earnings showed 12% year-over-year growth for the S&P 500. Revenue growth near 9% and margin gains across most sectors suggest the core backdrop remains firm. Still, with single stock swings at multi-decade highs, many expect volatility to remain a key theme in the weeks ahead.The final week of February brings a packed calendar, with AI leaders, retail giants, energy firms, and financial names all set to report. Investors will look for updates on demand trends, cost control, and how AI spending plans are shaping guidance across sectors.
