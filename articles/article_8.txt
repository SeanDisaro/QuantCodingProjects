AI chip demand is skyrocketing, and Wall Street is betting big on the companies powering the next wave of innovation. Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and TSMC (TSM) have emerged as the must-watch names for 2026 as the industry shifts toward faster chips and massive data-center buildouts.Notably, these stocks form part of analyst Daniel Ives’ AI list, which is a selection of 30 tech companies chosen by Ives and his team. For context, Ives is a Wall Street analyst at Wedbush Securities, known for his strong calls on AI and cloud stocks. On TipRanks, he holds a five-star rating and ranks #399 out of more than 10,000 analysts, underscoring his credibility with investors.Let’s dig deeper:
		Nvidia remains the powerhouse of the AI chip world, thanks to its dominant data center GPUs that power most of today’s AI training and inference workloads. Demand for Nvidia’s chips continues to surge as companies race to build and scale AI models, which will drive massive revenue and earnings growth well into 2026. While its valuation is high, its dominant market share and software ecosystem create significant barriers for competitors, making it the momentum play of the sector.Ives says, “it’s Nvidia’s world — everyone else is paying rent,” and with the company’s AI chips reportedly sold out through 2026, he argues that doubting the company’s dominance is wrong, despite the progress being made by rivals.According to TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the last three months. At $258.45, the Nvidia average share price target implies a 47% upside potential.AMD is quickly gaining ground as a strong alternative to Nvidia, especially with its growing lineup of AI accelerators and next-gen chips. Wedbush sees AMD as one of the key beneficiaries of the AI boom and believes it can gain meaningful market share in data centers over the next few years. Overall, analysts project significant growth in AMD’s earnings and bottom-line growth in 2026 as its latest chip architectures gain market traction.Wedbush, through analysts Ives and Matt Bryson, maintains a bullish stance on AMD stock. They also raised their price target to $270 from the previous target of $190, thanks to AMD’s growing momentum in AI. The firm highlights AMD’s major AI wins with cloud providers and companies like OpenAI (PC:OPAIQ) and Oracle (ORCL), which are adopting its Instinct GPUs and EPYC server chips.
		Overall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on AMD stock, based on 28 Buys and nine Holds assigned in the last three months. The average share price target for AMD is $284.16, which implies an upside potential of 35.3% from current levels.TSMC isn’t designing AI chips — it’s building them. As the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer, TSMC produces the most advanced semiconductors for top tech companies. As demand for high-performance chips grows, TSMC stands to benefit directly from every major player expanding its AI production.TSM is among the top five holdings in the Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (IVES), highlighting Wedbush’s long-term conviction in the company’s vital role in the future of technology.Looking ahead, Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about TSMC’s growth, with eight out of nine analysts giving the stock a Buy rating. Meanwhile, TSM’s average stock price target of $353.25 points to a potential upside of 20.5% from current levels.Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we compared leading AI chip stocks to see which one offers the highest upside potential based on Wall Street analyst forecasts.
