The major averages were mixed near noon following two days of gains as investors take profits and shift focus to this week’s key economic data. Last session’s advance was driven by tech and AI-linked names, with chipmakers and large tech stocks lifting benchmarks to new records. Memory and storage technology stocks, notably, helped support the broader market rally as the industry gathers at CES 2026 in Las Vegas. Private-sector employment increased in December, though by less than expected, according to data released by payrolls processor ADP. Companies added 41,000 jobs during the month, reversing a revised loss of 29,000 in November and offering some improvement after a period of weakness in the labor market toward the end of 2025. Private payrolls had contracted in three of the four months leading up to December. Looking to commodities, gold was edging lower, while oil was down roughly 1% after crude numbers from the API and DOE.
