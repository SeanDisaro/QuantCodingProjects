Data center operator Nebius (NBIS), which recently signed a $19.4 billion deal with U.S. tech giant Microsoft (MSFT), has rolled out a new AI platform for institutional users. The news excited investors of the Amsterdam-based company, which is backed by American chip colossus Nvidia (NVDA), with NBIS stock jumping about 5% during early trading on Wednesday. The rise offsets the over 8% loss seen from the previous day. The new platform, the Nebius Token Factory, enables businesses to deploy, optimize, and scale their open-source and custom artificial intelligence models. 
		Using Nebius, organizations can handle AI inference — the process by which AI makes data-driven decisions or predictions — and manage as well as control access to their trained models. These functions are secured and managed by Nebius. Nebius Token Factory is “the next evolution” of Nebius AI Studio, Nebius noted, referring to its earlier platform designed for developers and researchers to experiment with and fine-tune AI models. The new platform is compatible with more than 40 open-source AI models, including Nvidia’s (NVDA) Nemotron,  DeepSeek, Meta’s (META) Llama, OpenAI’s (PC:OPAIQ) GPT-OSS, and Alibaba’s (BABA) Qwen.According to Nebius, the new platform was built on top of Aether, its enterprise-grade AI cloud platform designed to run critical AI workloads. The Factory will help organizations reduce the cost of AI inference while reducing computational latency by up to 70%.“We built Nebius Token Factory not just to serve models, but to help customers solve real challenges and engineer for scale — optimizing inference pipelines and turning open models into production-ready systems,” noted Roman Chernin, Nebius’s co-founder.Already, Nebius has onboarded e-commerce tech investor Prosus (PRX), AI video platform Higgsfield AI, and open-source AI community organizer Hugging Face as customers. 
		The launch of the platform comes as Nebius joins the ranks of “neo-cloud” companies — smaller-scale, specialized data center infrastructure providers — that have emerged to bridge the gap for critical AI workloads demanded by Big Tech firms such as Microsoft.Nebius’s rival IREN Limited (IREN) recently snagged a $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft to provide the US tech leader with access to Nvidia’s GB300 graphics processing units. The goal is to power Microsoft’s next-generation AI cloud infrastructure.On Wall Street, Nebius’s shares currently hold a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four Buys and one Hold issued by analysts over the past three months. Moreover, the average NBIS price target of $149.50 indicates about a 35% upswing from the current level.See more NBIS analyst ratings here.
