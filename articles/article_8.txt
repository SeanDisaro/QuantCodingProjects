Nvidia (NVDA) reached a new milestone on Wednesday, becoming the first company to hit a $5 trillion market valuation. The rise followed Nvidia’s GTC Conference in Washington, D.C., where CEO Jensen Huang announced over $500 billion in orders for its new Blackwell and Rubin AI chips and revealed several new partnerships. Nvidia stock closed 2% higher on Wednesday, extending its year-to-date gain to more than 54%.The company’s rise shows its growing importance in the global AI market. Its chips now power data centers, cloud platforms, and autonomous systems. Analysts see about $500 billion in future revenue visibility, backed by strong chip orders and rising data center demand. Despite higher costs, Nvidia has kept solid profit margins, boosting investor confidence in its outlook.Following the GTC conference, Melius Research raised its price target on Nvidia to $300 from $275, citing faster-than-expected growth in AI infrastructure demand. The firm said Nvidia’s early lead in chip design and software gives it a clear edge over rivals like AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). Melius added that it now sees a path to over $800 billion in annual revenue by the end of the decade, as AI adoption continues to accelerate.
		Similarly, Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso reiterated an Outperform rating on Nvidia with a $230 price target, saying the company’s disclosure of $500 billion in expected chip orders points to “significant upside compared with current Wall Street forecasts.” The company will report its Q3 FY26 earnings after the market closes on November 19. Wall Street expects NVDA to post earnings of $1.24 per share, up 53% from a year ago. Meanwhile, NVDA expects revenue of $54.57 billion, about 56% higher than the same period last year.Looking ahead, Nvidia’s main test will be keeping up its growth and lead in AI chips. Investors will watch how fast it ships Blackwell chips, its profit margins, and progress with data center deals.For now, Nvidia’s $5 trillion milestone shows its strong position in the AI boom. But with expectations already high, the next few quarters will show whether the chip giant can keep growing, or if its success is already built into the stock.Analysts remain highly optimistic about Nvidia’s long-term outlook. On TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 34 Buys, two Holds, and one Sell rating. The average Nvidia price target of $230.22 implies nearly 11.2% upside potential from current levels.
