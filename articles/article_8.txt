Alibaba (BABA) is moving closer to a potential public listing of its AI chip unit, T-Head, according to a Bloomberg report, as investor interest grows in AI chipmakers amid limits on Nvidia’s (NVDA) products in China. Following the report, Alibaba’s U.S.-listed shares rallied on Thursday.Bloomberg said Alibaba plans to restructure T-Head into a separate business with partial employee ownership, a step often taken ahead of a listing. The company is exploring an IPO, though no timeline has been set.Founded in 2018, T-Head designs chips for computing and storage. While it remains smaller than global leaders, it has made steady progress at home. The unit recently signed a deal to supply AI accelerators for a large data center run by China Unicom, placing its chips alongside other domestic rivals.
		AI chips are in short supply, and demand is rising fast as companies build larger data centers and AI systems. In China, this has increased the push to cut reliance on U.S. chipmakers, lifting interest in local chip developers like T-Head.Recent listings and IPO plans by other Chinese chip firms have also drawn strong investor interest. Expectations of policy support from Beijing are adding to that momentum, even though many of these companies are still in early stages.Beyond Alibaba, other Chinese tech giants, including Baidu (BIDU), are also developing their own chips as they look for local alternatives to Nvidia hardware, which faces export limits into China.Alibaba has been designing its own chips for years to support its cloud and data center business. As it pushes deeper into AI, that chip work is becoming more important, linking software, services, and the hardware needed to run them.Alibaba is backing this strategy with heavy spending. Chief executive Eddie Wu has pledged more than $53 billion for AI and infrastructure, underlining how important this shift is to Alibaba’s future.
		Wall Street remains constructive on the stock. Alibaba stock carries a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 14 unanimous Buy ratings over the past three months. The average BABA price target stands at $203.09, suggesting roughly 20.41% upside from current levels.See more BABA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
