Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) are two of the biggest winners of the AI boom, powering everything from data centers to advanced AI models. As both companies gear up to report quarterly earnings, investors are watching closely to see which is better positioned to capitalize on surging AI demand. With valuations running high and expectations even higher, the upcoming results could serve as a key catalyst for both stocks.Nvidia dominates the market for AI chips that power data centers, while Broadcom plays a critical behind-the-scenes role, supplying networking solutions, custom silicon, and infrastructure that keep those data centers operating efficiently. Year-to-date, NVDA stock is up 1.90%, while AVGO has slipped 0.97%.Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we compared these stocks across key metrics to find out which stock analysts see offering more upside ahead of earnings and in 2026.
		Let’s take a look at the details. Nvidia will report its Q4 FY26 on February 25. Wall Street expects Nvidia to post Q4 FY26 earnings of $1.52 per share, up 70% from a year ago, with revenue projected to rise over 60% to $65.56 billion.Overall, investors are looking beyond 2026 and want greater clarity on 2027. They’re focused on revenue visibility, the timing of the Rubin ramp, China’s contribution, progress with non-hyperscaler customers, and the durability of margin expansion. Ultimately, it’s management’s transparency on these longer-term drivers — not short-term earnings beats — that will determine whether Nvidia’s premium valuation remains justified into next year.On Wall Street, Goldman Sachs’ five-star-rated analyst James Schneider says investor expectations are high ahead of Nvidia’s earnings, supported by strong chip demand and rising cloud spending. He expects Nvidia to beat estimates with around $67.3 billion in Q4 revenue and solid momentum into early fiscal 2026. However, he believes the stock’s near-term move will depend more on management’s outlook for 2027 growth than on 2026 results, which are largely priced in.Overall, analysts are strongly bullish on NVDA stock, with 37 of the 39 analysts covering the stock giving it a Buy rating. Meanwhile, NVDA’s average stock price target of $260.06 indicates 38% upside potential from current levels.
		Broadcom will report its Q1 FY26 earnings on March 4. Analysts expect earnings of $2.02 per share, up from $1.60 a year ago, on revenue of $19.21 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth. Compared to Nvidia, Broadcom’s growth rates appear more modest, as Nvidia has been delivering significantly faster revenue expansion driven by surging demand for its AI GPUs. However, Broadcom’s growth is viewed as more diversified and potentially steadier, supported by its custom AI chips and networking business. Investors will likely focus on whether Broadcom can sustain strong AI-related momentum and expand margins, even if its overall growth pace trails Nvidia’s.Ahead of earnings, UBS’ five-star-rated analyst Timothy Arcuri maintained its Buy rating and $475.00 price target on AVGO stock. He sees accelerating demand for the company’s TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) products. Broadcom’s TPUs are a credible alternative to Nvidia’s GPUs, particularly for large-scale AI deployments where cost efficiency matters most. These TPUs are well-positioned for AI inference workloads and are significantly more affordable, typically priced between $10,500 and $15,000, compared with Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, which sell for roughly $40,000 to $50,000.Arcuri expects Broadcom to ship more than 5 million TPU units in 2027, up from roughly 3.7 million units projected for 2026. He forecasts that Broadcom’s AI revenue could climb to roughly $60 billion in fiscal 2026, marking an estimated 200% year-over-year increase.Currently, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Broadcom stock based on 29 Buys and one Hold assigned over the last three months. The average AVGO stock price target of $457.75 indicates 34.46% upside potential from current levels.Both Nvidia and Broadcom are strong AI stocks, but they offer different opportunities ahead of earnings. Nvidia still leads the AI chip market with strong demand and pricing power, though its high valuation means expectations are already very high. Broadcom is growing quickly in AI through its TPU and custom chip business and trades at a more reasonable valuation.
		Investors who prefer an established market leader may lean toward Nvidia. Those looking for faster growth and potentially more upside may find Broadcom more attractive in the long term.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
