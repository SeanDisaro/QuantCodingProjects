Nvidia (NVDA) shares are up nearly 2% in premarket trading at the time of writing following reports of a potential restart in GPU shipments to China. According to a Reuters report, Nvidia plans to begin shipping its H200 GPUs to China by mid-February, assuming it receives final government approval. The report added that shipments could even start before the Lunar New Year, using existing inventory.Initial deliveries are expected to total 5,000 to 10,000 modules, equal to roughly 40,000 to 80,000 H200 chips. If approvals go through, Nvidia is expected to ramp up production further, with additional supply coming online in the second quarter.That matters because China remains an important market for Nvidia, even under tighter U.S. export rules. The H200 chips are less powerful than Nvidia’s latest Blackwell line, making them more likely to clear regulatory hurdles.
		Earlier this month, Donald Trump said he had approved the sale of Nvidia’s H200 GPUs to China, subject to a 25% fee. More recently, the U.S. Commerce Department forwarded Nvidia’s license applications to the State, Energy, and Defense Departments, which now have 30 days to review and respond.Nvidia did not comment on the report, but the news was enough to lift investor confidence, as a reopening of China shipments could ease revenue concerns tied to export controls and show Nvidia can still meet global AI demand within the rules.According to TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the last three months. At $263.58, the Nvidia average share price target implies a 46% upside potential.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
