Ray Dalio, co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, has published a long post on X that seeks to put a clean frame around a messy moment, and he makes clear that the shift he sees has a real financial impact on debt, stocks, and cash over time. He cites remarks at the Munich Security Conference, where leaders said the post-1945 world order is no longer in place. He then ties that shift to his own “Big Cycle” view of how global power tends to move over time.Dalio says we are now in what he calls Stage 6, when rules fade, power matters more, and big states push harder for what they want. He writes that this stage brings “great disorder” because “might is right” and there is a “clash of great powers.” He also shares a simple rule for how to act in this kind of world: “Have power, respect power, and use power wisely.”Dalio starts with the idea that global order works like local order, but with a key gap. Inside a state, there are laws, cops, courts, and clear costs for bad acts. Across states, those tools are weak or do not exist in a way that can bind top powers. As a result, he argues that raw power sets the pace more than law does.
		He also argues that groups like the U.N. do not run the world, as top states can outspend and outmuscle them. In his view, when a top power has more weight than the group, the group bends. That is why he says the global system often runs on threat, deal, or fight, not on court-style rule.From there, Dalio lays out five kinds of conflict, and he treats them like steps that can build over time. The list is trade war, tech war, capital war, geopolitical war, and then hot war. He notes that most of the first four do not use guns, but they still aim to harm the other side. He also warns that once a hot war starts, all other tools will be used at full force.He points to the fear loop where each side thinks it must act first, plus tit-for-tat moves that are hard to stop. He adds a blunt line that fits his tone: “the two things about war that one can be most confident in are 1) that it won’t go as planned and 2) that it will be far worse than imagined.”Dalio is a macro investor, so his worldview has a money angle at every step. The key point for markets is that power fights do not stay in speech or maps. They often hit trade, chips, credit, and cash flow, which is where stocks and bonds live.First, his list of “wars” aligns well with what many firms face today. A trade war can mean new tariffs, curbs on key goods, and cost hikes in supply lines. A tech war can mean bans on chips, limits on AI tools, and less cross-border deal flow. A capital war can mean fines, blocks, asset freezes, and less access to key pools of cash. Even when there is no hot war, these steps can still hit sales, cost, and margin.
		Next, Dalio leans hard on the idea that late-cycle stress pulls states toward more state control. In his World War II case study, he points to price caps, ration rules, limits on cash moves, and a tight grip on what gets made. He also notes that in war, “stock market closures were common,” which is a sharp risk that most investors do not price in day-to-day.He also makes a clear claim on debt. He says wars are paid for with heavy borrowing and money printing, which can cut the real worth of cash and bonds over time. He puts it in plain terms when he says war is “financed by borrowing and printing money,” which can “devalue” money and debt. You do not need to agree with every line to see the link. Big spend, wide gaps, and weak trust can lead to higher term costs, more risk pay, and more swings in rates.Then there is the safe asset point. Dalio notes that in war, states and banks may not trust each other’s paper, so hard assets can play a role. He says gold, and at times barter, can act as the base coin. That does not mean a gold boom is set in stone. Still, it is a hint that in a high-stress path, the market may prize assets that do not rely on a rival’s promise.For equity sectors, his frame tends to favor firms tied to the “four wars” list. That can mean firms with local supply, key parts, and state ties. It can also mean defense names as state budgets rise. For a quick read, Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and RTX Corporation (RTX) sit in that mix. In chips and AI, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are central to the tech war theme, as chips are now part of state power. After that first mention, the names matter more than the tickers, since the main point is the trend.Still, there is a clear risk on the other side. In a split world, global scale can lose some of its edge. Firms with deep China sales, wide cross-border build chains, or heavy export risk can face more rule shifts. That can show up as hit-or-miss demand, slow permit paths, and more cost to move goods and data.
		Dalio is not giving a short-term trade call. He is saying the world may be moving from a rules-first era to a power-first era. If that is right, then the market playbook shifts a bit. You may see more policy risk in earnings, more gap risk in rates, and more sharp moves around trade, chips, and cash blocks.At the same time, Dalio’s own core rule is not doom. It is a guide for how states may act. “Have power, respect power, and use power wisely.”We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to assemble all the tickers mentioned in the piece.
