Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock tumbled 3.5% on Tuesday morning, giving back a chunk of Monday’s gains as the market reacted to a mix of geopolitical jitters and mounting competition in the red-hot AI chip space. The decline followed reports that China’s transport ministry will investigate a U.S. probe into Chinese shipping practices, a move that stirred broader fears of an escalating trade conflict.Adding to the pressure, sentiment toward Nvidia was further dampened by Broadcom’s announcement on Monday of a 10-gigawatt AI accelerator partnership with OpenAI. The deal, which closely mirrors Nvidia’s own 10-GW infrastructure agreement with the ChatGPT maker last month, signaled that competition in high-performance AI computing is heating up fast. The development weighed on Nvidia shares as investors reassessed the company’s dominance in an increasingly crowded race for AI infrastructure leadership.Still, Piper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar, an analyst ranked in 7th spot amongst the thousands of Wall Street stock experts, sees little reason to doubt Nvidia’s footing. The top analyst points out, following conversations with management, that “business conditions for NVDA remain robust, with demand still outstripping manufacturing capacity and supply.” Kumar also addressed the debate surrounding Nvidia’s investments in AI customers such as OpenAI and CoreWeave, writing that the company’s funding activity “is insulated from circular financing concerns.”
		Kumar says that the company clarified that “investment dollars provided to customers, including OpenAI and neoclouds, cannot be turned around to purchase their GPUs,” adding that the funds are reserved for land, power, and staffing needs. “We view this as a key clarification that no circular financing is going on for NVDA,” Kumar noted.On the OpenAI deal itself, the analyst emphasized that Nvidia’s $100 billion agreement “was not contingent on an investment but was separate from the business component,” describing the investment as a strategic stake in a leading AI innovator. Nvidia, Kumar said, is enabling OpenAI to build and operate its own AI factories – effectively giving it hyperscaler capabilities without relying on cloud providers.Kumar also highlighted the strong scale of Nvidia’s market opportunity, citing management’s estimate that “every GW of AI infrastructure deployed represents $35B-$40B in TAM” for the company.To this end, Kumar rates NVDA shares an Overweight (i.e., Buy), along with a $225 price target that implies a 24% upside from current levels.
