Welcome to another biweekly update on all things quantum computing. This edition covers a new study on the limits of quantum progress, fresh U.S. government partnerships in Asia, and a key funding round in light-based chips. Let’s go.We begin with a new paper published by Jens Eisert of Freie Universität Berlin and John Preskill of Caltech, which says that quantum computing is moving fast, but true large-scale systems are still years away. The researchers say today’s machines from companies like Google (GOOGL) (GOOG) and IBM (IBM) are impressive yet still too noisy to run long programs.They note that current chips hold more than 100 qubits, and error rates have dropped sharply. However, building a functional quantum computer will require about one million qubits to form just one thousand stable “logical” qubits. For now, scientists rely on a process called error mitigation, which helps reduce the effect of noise but does not fix it.
		The study predicts that the first real use of quantum power will come in science labs before it reaches business or finance. Researchers are focusing on simulations for materials, chemistry, and physics that cannot be solved with classical computers.In other quantum news, the White House has signed new Technology Prosperity Deals with Japan and South Korea to deepen partnerships in quantum computing, AI, and other key areas. These agreements are part of a wider plan to align standards, share research, and protect intellectual property.In Japan, the focus is on building secure research systems for shared quantum infrastructure. In South Korea, the deal targets stronger supply chains for quantum components and shared work on AI safety. Both countries will also team up with the U.S. on 6G networks, space exploration, and fusion energy.Officials say these steps aim to ensure the security of any technological development. The goal is to link economic growth with national resilience, while helping each partner compete globally in advanced computing and communications.Meanwhile, IBM Quantum researchers have used machine learning to predict how long quantum jobs will take to complete. The team trained a model on more than 150,000 jobs to forecast completion times based on circuit depth, shot count, and other metadata.
		This system could help improve how quantum computers manage their workloads, making them faster and easier to use. It also shows how AI tools can help run quantum systems more efficiently, saving both time and energy.Q.ANT, a startup based in Stuttgart, has raised $80 million in new funding to expand its photonic computing business. The investment, led by Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Family Office, is the largest funding round for light-based processors in Europe so far.Q.ANT’s chips use light instead of electricity to perform calculations. The firm says this method can be up to 30 times more energy efficient than current processors. The company plans to deploy its Native Processing Server, built on Thin-Film Lithium Niobate, in data centers across the U.S.Global spending on AI data infrastructure is expected to exceed $5.2 trillion in the next five years. Q.ANT says its chips could help cut energy use and expand capacity without the need for extra cooling.Scientists at the Changchun Institute of Optics in China have used topological materials to generate new types of terahertz light. The work shows how special quantum materials can create both even and odd harmonics, opening new uses in high-speed wireless and quantum communication.
		The result marks progress in the field of ultrafast electronics and optical sensors, showing how new materials may soon shape how quantum systems interact with light.We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to line up all the leading quantum stocks. It’s a quick way to see how they stack up and where the field could be heading.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
