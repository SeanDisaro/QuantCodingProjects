Stock futures are trading slightly lower to begin the final trading week of the year, as markets settle back into holiday mode after a strong rally that pushed the S&P 500 and Dow to record highs last week. Traders are wrestling with profit-taking in major tech and AI-linked names even as the broader benchmark indexes remain close to all-time peaks. Precious metals have pulled back, contributing to cautious positioning among risk assets, while energy and select cyclical names show pockets of relative strength.Globally, European markets have been mostly flat as basic-resources gains offset declines in defensive and aerospace stocks, and Gulf markets have shown mixed performance as traders balance expectations for U.S. rate cuts with weak oil prices. In pre-market trading, S&P 500 futures fell 0.31%, Nasdaq futures fell 0.48% and Dow futures fell 0.12%.
