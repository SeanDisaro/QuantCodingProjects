UiPath (PATH) stock surged over 14% on Tuesday after the software company disclosed several high-profile AI partnerships that signal its deeper push into agentic automation. The company has joined hands with technology leaders such as Nvidia (NVDA), OpenAI, Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL), and Snowflake (SNOW).These partnerships aim to integrate cutting-edge models like ChatGPT and Nvidia’s NIM (Nvidia Inference Microservice) into UiPath’s workflow tools. This will help businesses automate processes in areas such as fraud detection, healthcare, and customer service.The surge in PATH stock reflects investor optimism that these partnerships will boost enterprise AI adoption and strengthen the company’s role in the booming sector.
		UiPath will integrate Nvidia’s Nemotron models and NIM microservices in its ecosystem, allowing enterprises to deploy generative AI in sensitive areas like fraud detection and healthcare. Also, the companies launched an Integration Service Connector that connects UiPath with NVDA’s systems, making it easier to use AI for language, images, and predictions.Moving ahead, UiPath has teamed up with OpenAI to add GPT-5 to its Agent Builder, helping businesses create smarter AI tools. They are working on a connector that will directly integrate OpenAI’s advanced AI models into UiPath’s automation workflows.Further, UiPath is partnering with Google to use its Gemini models. This integration will allow users to build and interact with agentic automation workflows using voice commands rather than relying on complex coding.Lastly, UiPath’s deal with Snowflake brings together UiPath’s automation tools and Snowflake’s Cortex AI. By integrating their platforms, the companies aim to help businesses automate more complex tasks using real-time data and advanced machine learning.UiPath stock has gained about 9% year-to-date, which is behind the S&P 500 Index’s (SPX) 13% gain. However, with these new deals from Nvidia, OpenAI, and Snowflake, UiPath is shifting its role from just a robotic process automation (RPA) provider to a key player in AI. This shift could drive broader adoption of its platform across industries looking to streamline operations.

With strong customer retention and focus on AI expansion, the company is expected to benefit from the rising demand for AI workflows.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on PATH stock based on two Buys, 15 Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months.
