Shares in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) edged higher on Wednesday morning, despite a planned vote by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives on a bill that could stop the export of the powerful H200 AI chips to China.The bill, which has been dubbed the AI Overwatch Act, seeks to empower the U.S. Congress to make decisions on the export of AI chips. It was introduced in December by Brian Mast, a Florida House member and the committee’s chairman, after Trump proposed a 25% fee that would allow Nvidia and other chipmakers to export their advanced chips to China.Although the bill would still require approval by the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, even if it passes the committee vote, its provisions could be a concern for Nvidia, which is trying to revive its China sales from scratch.
		According to media reports, the legislation is being designed to empower the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as well as the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, to review within 30 days and possibly halt permissions granted for the export of advanced AI chips to China and other countries that are not American allies under national security grounds.Earlier this month, the Trump administration gave a conditional approval that allows Nvidia to export its H200 chips to China. Some of the conditions include third-party testing to confirm the chip’s AI capabilities and certification by the chipmaker that their domestic supply is sufficient.While the bill is facing pushback from the White House, including Trump’s AI czar, David Sacks, the administration has continued to seek to limit China’s access to advanced semiconductors made in the U.S. Last week, the administration announced a 25% tariff on “certain advanced AI chips,” including Nvidia H200 and Advanced Micro Devices’s (AMD) AMD MI325X. A White House official has called the announcement just the “phase one” of action designed to protect America’s semiconductor industry.On Wall Street, Nvidia’s shares continue to boast a Strong Buy consensus rating from analysts based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell issued by 41 analysts over the past three months.
		Moreover, the average NVDA price target of $263.44 implies about 44% upside from current trading levels.See more NVDA analyst ratings here.
