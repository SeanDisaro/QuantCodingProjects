1. Netflix upgraded to Buy at Seaport Research Seaport Research upgraded Netflix (NFLX) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $1,385, up from $1,230. The firm thinks the shares’ momentum, which has moderated lately, could be digesting the year-to-date +30% gains ahead of the advertising infrastructure build-related monetization momentum. Seaport also notes the continued year-over-year market share gains vs linear, but also the continued professional, curated content that is driving engagement leadership. The firm would be a buyer ahead of the Q3 print on October 21.2. Jefferies upgrades AMD to Buy on “multigenerational” OpenAI pact Jefferies upgraded AMD (AMD) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $300, up from $170. OpenAI’s plans to buy six gigawatts of AMD equipment changes the company’s “AI narrative,” the firm tells investors in a research note. Jefferies says the OpenAI partnership provides “strong validation” of AMD’s artificial intelligence roadmap and the level of AI demand in general. The firm cites its better server checks and AMD’s new “multigenerational” opportunity with OpenAI for the upgrade. Jefferies came away from its Asia trip “incrementally positive” on AMD due to potential share gains in server central processing units with Venice.3. Baird starts Oracle with Outperform on AI infrastructure exposure 
Baird initiated coverage of Oracle (ORCL) with an Outperform rating and $365 price target. The firm views Oracle as the “AI juggernaut for the information age.” The company is well positioned to benefit from the accelerating spend on artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as convergence of AI, data and use-cases that will emerge from the move from training to inference, Baird tells investors in a research note. This “virtuous circle” can support a premium valuation for Oracle and move the shares higher, contends the firm.Oracle initiated with a Buy at Phillip Securities Phillip Securities initiated coverage of Oracle with a Buy rating and $350 price target. The firm says the company’s remaining performance obligations backlog surged 359% in fiscal Q1 to $455B, driven by multi-billion-dollar deals. Oracle can accelerate its profit growth by scaling capacity and converting its backlog, Phillip tells investors in a research note.4. Micron upgraded to Overweight at Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley upgraded Micron (MU) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $220, up from $160. The company will see multiple quarters of double-digit price increases, which can drive “substantially higher earnings power,” the firm tells investors in a research note. Morgan Stanley believes this will alleviate any lingering questions on specialty high bandwidth memory for artificial intelligence. The firm’s DRAM and NAND channel checks continue to inflect positively, with buyers “showing anxiety” about availability through all of 2026 amid strong server and storage demand. It believes Micron will see multiple quarters of upward earnings revisions.
		5. Affirm upgraded to Buy at Rothschild & Co Redburn Rothschild & Co Redburn upgraded Affirm (AFRM) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $101, up from $74, which offers 30% upside. Affirm offers a “more established” product set and partnership-led international growth relative to Klarna (KLAR), the firm tells investors in a research note. Rothschild believes Affirm’s move into international markets will be a major contributor to its long-term growth. The firm says Affirm “currently represents the most compelling long-term investment opportunity.”Top 5 Sell Calls:1. Dollar Tree downgraded to Underperform at Jefferies Jefferies downgraded Dollar Tree (DLTR) to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $70, down from $110. The firm says inflation, management decisions, and tariffs “have turned a simple business model into a complex one.” Jefferies’ pricing analyses and channel checks indicate mounting execution risk and margin pressure for Dollar Tree. The firm sees an unfavorable risk/reward for the shares into the investor day. Jefferies sees a downside case of $5.00 in 2026 earnings per share versus the consensus estimate of $6.44.
		2. HSBC downgrades Intel to Reduce on “overdone” share rally HSBC analyst Frank Lee downgraded Intel (INTC) to Reduce from Hold with a price target of $24, up from $21.25. While the company’s the deals with SoftBank, U.S. government and Nvidia (NVDA) were at a discount to the market price, the stock is up 55% since the first deal announcement in August, the analyst tells investors in a research note. HSBC believes further deal announcements could drive the stock higher in the short term, but says Intel’s own fab execution remains key to any sustainable turnaround. As such, it believes the re-rating of Intel shares is overdone. A technology deal with TSMC (TSM) “is the only one that matters” and is unlikely despite potential for future investments, contends HSBC.3. Doximity downgraded to Underweight at JPMorgan JPMorgan downgraded Doximity (DOCS) to Underweight from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $62. The stock’s valuation premium to peers “appears excessive,” the firm tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan says Doximity’s growth visibility is limited by uncertain pharma digital advertising trends. The firm cites the company’s “challenging visibility of volatile advertising and the decelerating growth of pharma budgets” for the downgrade.4. Shake Shack downgraded to Underperform at BofA 
BofA analyst Sara Senatore downgraded Shake Shack (SHAK) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $86, down from $148. While stating that Shake Shack has done an “impressive job of systematizing its approach to innovation,” the firm sees margin pressure from competition and inflation at a time when the labor market is softening, and consumers’ restaurant spending has come under pressure.5. Pliant Therapeutics downgraded to Underweight at JPMorgan JPMorgan downgraded Pliant Therapeutics (PLRX) to Underweight from Neutral without a price target. The firm says the investment story “has remained in limbo” since the bexotegrast program for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was discontinued earlier this year. Pliant is weighing multiple strategic direction, from in-licensing new clinical-stage assets to merging with another biotech, JPMorgan tells investors in a research note. The firm believes the company “remains in a holding pattern” pending news on next steps.Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
