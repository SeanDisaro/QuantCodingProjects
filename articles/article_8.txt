Nvidia (NVDA) disclosed changes to its investment holdings in its latest quarterly 13-F filing covering positions as of December 31, 2025. The report shows the company sold its stake in Applied Digital (APLD) while also disclosing a large stake in Intel (INTC) along with a few other infrastructure-related companies. The update points to a shift toward hardware and networking suppliers that support AI data centers rather than smaller AI-linked businesses.The SEC filing indicates Nvidia exited multiple previously disclosed investments tied to the AI ecosystem. In its earlier report, Nvidia had owned millions of shares of Applied Digital, but  its latest filing revealed it had exited its roughly $177 million stake in the digital infrastructure company. Following the release of the filing, APLD shares tumbled 8.4% in after-hours trading on Tuesday. The development caught investors off guard, as Nvidia had previously been viewed as a strategic backer, and its decision to sell raised questions about the company’s outlook.
		In addition to Applied Digital, Nvidia sold stakes in Arm Holdings (ARM) and WeRide (WRD).The filing revealed a large disclosed position in Intel. Nvidia reported owning about 214.8 million Intel shares, worth roughly $7.9 billion at quarter-end.The portfolio also listed positions in Nokia (NOK) and chip-design software firm Synopsys (SNPS). Both companies are closely linked to the hardware behind AI systems — networking equipment and semiconductor development tools.The changes suggest Nvidia is putting more focus on the basic infrastructure needed to run large AI data centers.Overall, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Nvidia stock based on 37 Buy, one Hold, and one Sell recommendations. The average NVDA stock price target of $260.38 indicates 40.77% upside potential.
