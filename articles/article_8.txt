Nasdaq (NDAQ) is proposing a “fast entry” rule that it says will speed up the addition of newly listed companies to its exchange. The new fast entry rule is being floated by Nasdaq as it tries to attract more initial public offerings (IPOs). The proposal comes ahead of several blockbuster IPOs that are expected this year, including Elon Musk’s commercial space company SpaceX and artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic.Under the proposed fast entry rule, a new Nasdaq-listed company whose market capitalization ranks among the top 40 constituents in the exchange will be eligible for accelerated inclusion after 15 trading sessions and with only a few days’ notice.
		Under the fast entry rule, newly listed companies would be exempt from some liquidity requirements and they would not replace an existing index member right away. Newly listed stocks could be included even though the technology-heavy Nasdaq exchange would not be rebalanced until the end of a quarter.Nasdaq is looking to ensure that the biggest IPOs expected this year list on its exchange, where it is already home to trillion-dollar market-cap companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) and Alphabet (GOOGL). The Nasdaq houses the world’s biggest technology companies and serves as a barometer for the health of technology and growth-oriented publicly traded companies.Nasdaq’s stock has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 10 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on nine Buy and one Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. The average NDAQ price target of $111.50 implies 29.07% upside from current levels.
