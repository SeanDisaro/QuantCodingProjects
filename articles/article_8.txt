Google stock (GOOGL) is struggling to move higher today, as the sticker shock of its new debt levels sets in. While the company is successfully raising $20 billion through a seven-part bond sale, GOOGL stock remains flat, trading around $324. Investors are currently weighing the benefits of a massive AI war chest against the reality that Google’s long-term debt has now quadrupled to over $46 billion.The sheer size of today’s deal is catching the market off guard. Alphabet is selling $20 billion in senior notes, with maturities ranging from three years all the way to a highly unusual 40-year slice. Even more surprising is a reported century bond (100-year debt) being planned for the European market. This aggressive borrowing follows Google’s recent admission that it will spend up to $185 billion on capital projects this year, roughly double what it spent in 2025.A major reason Google stock isn’t rallying on the news is the change in how the company uses its cash. Management is currently paring back share repurchases to divert every possible dollar into AI hardware and data centers. For years, investors relied on Google’s massive buybacks to keep the stock price rising. Now, that money is going toward buying Nvidia (NVDA) chips and building server farms, a shift that creates long-term value but removes the short-term safety net that many traders expect.
		The market is currently in a “show me” phase regarding AI profits. While Google Cloud is growing at 48%, investors remain concerned that the $630 billion total AI spend from Big Tech this year won’t pay off quickly enough. With the 40-year bond pricing at nearly 1% above Treasuries, the cost of borrowing is no longer free. Until Google can prove that its Gemini AI is driving significant new ad revenue, the stock may continue to trade sideways as it absorbs this massive increase in debt.Alphabet’s stock (GOOGL) continues to carry a Strong Buy consensus, based on 33 analyst ratings over the past three months. Out of those, 26 call it a Buy, while seven recommend a Hold.
