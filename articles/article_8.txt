Sony (SONY) stock got a slight boost on Monday alongside new rumors and leaks concerning the specifications for the PlayStation 6. According to these new leaks, Sony is looking for a major upgrade with the PS6, including the ability to run games with graphics comparable to what’s produced on an Nvidia (NVDA) RTX 5090 with ray tracing enabled.These latest rumors claim that Sony will be able to achieve this with the help of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). AMD is reportedly working on the APU that will be used in the PlayStation 6, which is codenamed Orion. This makes sense as AMD has strong ties to Sony and Microsoft (MSFT), providing both with processors for their gaming consoles. It also supplies Valve with the processors for its Steam Deck gaming PC. Nintendo (NTDOY) is the only one of the big console makers that relies on Nvidia.Other potential PlayStation 6 specs included in this leak are 40 GB of GDDR7 memory, as well as reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) for upscaling. This tracks with other console makers and PC games utilizing AI to produce higher frame rates in games.
