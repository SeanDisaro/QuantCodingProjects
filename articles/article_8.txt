On Feb. 17, Nvidia (NVDA) backed Mistral AI, a leading French AI company, made its first expansion move by bringing on Paris-based startup Koyeb. Koyeb, known for its serverless infrastructure for AI applications, will contribute its technology and engineering team to support Mistral AI’s cloud platform. Mistral AI recently acquired Koyeb, integrating 13 employees and three co-founders into its team. Following the acquisition, Koyeb’s serverless platform, sandboxes, and GPU inference capabilities are now being incorporated into Mistral’s Compute cloud infrastructure. As a result, Mistral AI is strengthening artificial intelligence infrastructure across Europe while enabling enterprises to deploy AI models more quickly and efficiently to meet growing global demand.Koyeb’s co-founders, Yann Léger, Edouard Bonlieu, and Bastien Chatelard, will report to Mistral AI’s CTO, Timothée Lacroix, and will focus on scaling AI inference and enterprise deployment. Meanwhile, the startup’s platform will continue operating while gradually integrating with Mistral Compute, ensuring a seamless transition for existing users. This integration emphasizes Mistral’s strategy of combining high-performance infrastructure with AI software to provide end-to-end solutions.
		Reflecting its market position, Mistral AI was last valued at around $13.8 billion and recently reported $400 million in annual recurring revenue, highlighting its European market leadership. In addition, Koyeb had raised $8.6 million to date, including a $1.6 million pre-seed round in 2020, followed in 2023 by a $7 million seed round led by Paris-based VC firm Serena, whose principal, Floriane de Maupeou, celebrated the acquisition. To support expansion, Mistral AI is also investing $1.4 billion in data centers in Sweden to expand capacity and retain European control over AI infrastructure.Interestingly, Koyeb operates tens of thousands of applications on bare-metal servers across 10 locations worldwide, emphasizing high-performance AI infrastructure at sustainable costs. Meanwhile, Mistral Compute deploys 40 MW of data center capacity and 18,000 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs, providing concrete metrics for its global scale. Moreover, Koyeb and Mistral AI share a mission to build world-class AI infrastructure, aligning technology, teams, and operations for enterprise solutions. As part of this collaboration, Mistral AI is extending its ambitions beyond large language models to offer full-stack AI capabilities.Nvidia is currently rated a “Strong Buy” by analysts on TipRanks, with shares trading around $261 and over 40% upside potential.
