The AI-related spending across the tech industry is both necessary and sustainable, according to Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking on CNBC Halftime Report, Huang said that the massive investments make sense because major tech companies’ cash flows are set to grow. From his perspective, companies are spending more today because they expect to earn significantly more tomorrow. As a result, Nvidia, which produces chips that are critical for AI, saw its shares finish the day up nearly 8% on Friday.These comments follow earnings reports from Nvidia’s largest customers, including Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT). Together, these hyperscalers could spend as much as $660 billion on capital expenditures this year, with a large portion going toward AI infrastructure and Nvidia chips. Importantly, Huang described this moment as the largest infrastructure buildout in history, which is driven by exceptionally strong demand for computing power that companies can directly monetize.To explain that demand, Huang pointed to how customers are actually using AI today. For example, Meta is upgrading its recommendation systems from older CPU-based models to generative AI and autonomous agents. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are using Nvidia-powered AI to improve product recommendations and enterprise software. Huang also added that even Nvidia chips sold six years ago are fully rented, which strengthened his belief that as long as AI remains profitable, demand for computing power will continue to grow quickly.
