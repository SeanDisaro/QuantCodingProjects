Crusoe’s AI cloud platform, Crusoe Cloud, empowers AI builders to focus on innovating rather than managing complex infrastructure.AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES: In a post to X, Nvidia stated, “We’re collaborating with @Uber to advance autonomous vehicle development. Together, we’re exploring how foundation models trained on large-scale, real-world driving data can accelerate progress in autonomy. Using data from Uber’s diverse driving scenarios-spanning airport pickups, complex intersections, and variable weather-we post-trained NVIDIA Cosmos World Foundation Models to improve realism and safety.” 
		STRATEGIC INVESTMENT: SuperX AI Technology (SUPX) announced a strategic investment in MicroInference, a Singapore-based Solution Provider for Compute and Networking in the Nvidia Partner Network, or NPN. Immediately after the investment, SuperX will have a majority shareholding in MicroInference. This investment is a key component of SuperX’s long-term strategy to build a high-performance AI ecosystem and strengthen its supply chain for advanced Nvidia servers and networking equipment, addressing the growing demand for full-stack AI solutions. The strategic investment is designed to accelerate the deployment of AI capabilities and Modular AI Factories across Asia Pacific, providing the scalable computing power necessary for regional innovation to flourish. By acquiring a majority stake in MicroInference, SuperX gains greater access to the specialized technical expertise and solutions within the Nvidia ecosystem, supporting its long-term growth and mission to build the next generation of intelligent infrastructure. The capital injection will enable MicroInference to significantly scale its operations, expand its team of certified Nvidia experts, and enhance its capacity to architect and deploy complex AI infrastructures.EXPANDED USE: Anthropic announced that it plans to expand its use of Google (GOOGL) Cloud technologies, including up to one million TPUs, dramatically increasing compute resources. The expansion is worth tens of billions of dollars and is expected to bring well over a gigawatt of capacity online in 2026. Anthropic now serves more than 300,000 business customers, and its number of large accounts, customers that each represent more than $100,000 in run-rate revenue, has grown nearly 7x in the past year. This expansion will help the company serve this rapidly growing customer demand. The company said these greater computational resources will also power more thorough testing, alignment research, and responsible deployment at scale. Anthropic’s compute strategy focuses on a diversified approach that uses three chip platforms-Google’s TPUs, Amazon’s (AMZN) Trainium, and Nvidia’s GPUs. Anthropic will continue to invest in additional compute capacity. “Anthropic’s choice to significantly expand its usage of TPUs reflects the strong price-performance and efficiency its teams have seen with TPUs for several years,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO at Google Cloud. “We are continuing to innovate and drive further efficiencies and increased capacity of our TPUs, building on our already mature AI accelerator portfolio, including our seventh generation TPU, Ironwood.”ROBOTAXI: Pony AI (PONY) announced the rollout of its 300th jointly manufactured Arcfox Alpha T5 Robotaxi – a production milestone that accelerates the company’s trajectory toward large-scale deployment and commercialization. The Arcfox Alpha T5 Robotaxi was jointly developed and produced in partnership with BAIC. As mass production accelerates, Pony AI plans to deploy the Alpha T5 Robotaxi for commercial ride-hailing services across China’s Tier-1 cities, while also actively exploring opportunities in key international markets such as the Middle East and Europe. The model has already obtained on-road testing permits in Beijing and Shenzhen and is currently undergoing fully driverless testing and validation in preparation for large-scale deployment later this year. Pony AI is on track to meet its year-end goals of expanding its combined fleet to 1,000 vehicles and achieving unit economic break-even.Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
