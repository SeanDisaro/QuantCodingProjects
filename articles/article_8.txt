Amazon Web Services, an Amazon.com (AMZN) company, and Humain announced at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum their plans to provide, deploy and manage up to 150,000 AI accelerators in a data center facility known as an “AI Zone” in Riyadh. As part of the expanded partnership, AWS will become Humain’s preferred AI partner globally, and the two companies will collaborate to bring AI compute and services from Saudi Arabia to customers worldwide, the parties stated. “The first-of-a-kind AI Zone in Saudi Arabia will support cutting-edge AI training and inference workloads with access to the latest NVIDIA (NVDA) GB300 AI infrastructure and AWS’s Trainium AI chips. The infrastructure will support a broad range of compute-intensive AI workloads, including model training and running inference for AI applications. This will enable customers to rapidly move from concept to production while responsibly leveraging NVIDIA infrastructure and AI software seamlessly integrated with AWS infrastructure and services. This industry-leading, accelerated computing infrastructure-delivered with the security, scale, and reliability required to run AI workloads with confidence-will establish Saudi Arabia’s first AI Zone as among the most modern and innovative in the world,” they said.Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
