AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems (PC:CER66) is gearing up to file for a U.S. initial public offering (IPO) in the next week and is aiming to go public as early as the second quarter of 2026, Reuters reported. The move comes as demand for specialized AI hardware continues to surge, driven by the rapid adoption of large language models, and enterprise AI workloads. Also, the need for alternatives to Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominant GPU ecosystem continues to grow.Moreover, the filing news comes after Cerebras pulled its IPO filing in October 2025 after initially filing in late 2024. The company withdrew the offering days after raising more than $1 billion in fresh funding, citing the need to update financials, strategy, and ongoing U.S. national‑security scrutiny tied to its former investor, Abu Dhabi-based G42.Cerebras has been preparing for an IPO by expanding partnerships, increasing production of its wafer-scale AI chips, and boosting its financial position.
		The company’s Wafer Scale Engine is one of the largest AI processors, designed to train large models faster and more efficiently than traditional GPU systems. This has helped the company win deals with cloud providers, research labs, and government agencies that need high-performance AI computing.A 2026 IPO would give Cerebras a chance to tap into strong demand for AI infrastructure. Also, investors are looking for companies that can benefit from the next wave of AI. Further, Cerebras’ unique technology makes it appealing as the industry looks for scalable, energy-efficient computing.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on NVDA stock based on 40 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Further, the average Nvidia price target of $260 per share implies 44.30% upside potential.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
