Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock remained flat on Wednesday alongside rumors of a new graphics processing unit (GPU) from the chipmaker. According to this rumor from Board Channels, AMD is developing a new entry in the RX 9070 GRE line. The rumors claim that this will be an updated version of the GPU that comes equipped with 16 GB of RAM, compared to the current model’s 12 GB.If AMD does upgrade the RX 9070 GRE with 16 GB of RAM, it would put it in line with the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. The rumors claim the company is considering this upgrade to meet growing demand for 16 GB GPUs. This makes sense as higher-quality graphics in games demand more RAM.The rumors surrounding an RX 9070 GRE update also revealed a potential release window for the GPU. They claim AMD will release the card sometime in September or October. It’s worth noting that the current RX 9070 GRE model was released on May 8, 2025. While that card received praise for its performance, some reviewers noted it still fell behind comparable offerings from rival GPU maker Nvidia (NVDA).
		AMD stock was largely flat on Wednesday, showing little effect from the latest RX 9070 GRE rumors. Even so, the shares remained up 37.85% year-to-date and 13.84% over the past 12 months. While growing AI demand has benefited AMD stock in 2025, tariffs, export bans, and other economic factors have also affected the shares.Turning to Wall Street, the analysts’ consensus rating for AMD is Moderate Buy, based on 26 Buy and 10 Hold ratings over the past three months. With that comes an average AMD stock price target of $184.91, representing a potential 11.08% upside for the shares.See more AMD stock analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
