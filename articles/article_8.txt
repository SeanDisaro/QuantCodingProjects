Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) heads into this week’s fiscal third-quarter earnings as the reigning market force, despite the stock’s recent 8% pullback. The retreat has taken place along with a broader tech sell-off, as doubts have surfaced about the Fed moving ahead with a rate cut in December, while debate continues over lofty tech valuations and a possible AI-driven bubble.Nevertheless, with the readout slated to take place on Wednesday (November 19), Oppenheimer’s Rick Schafer, an analyst who ranks in 8th spot among the thousands of Street stock experts, thinks the scene is set for another robust display from the AI chip king.Driven by the new GB300 Ultra, the analyst sees potential upside to the Street’s F3Q (October quarter) sales/EPS estimates of $54.7 billion/$1.25 and the F4Q (January) outlook of $61.5 billion/$1.42. Schafer expects Data Center (DC) revenue, which accounts for 88% of the business, to rise 58% year-over-year (19% quarter-over-quarter) as deployments shift from GB200 to GB300, with top cloud service providers installing roughly 1,000 racks per week. Management has noted a backlog of 20 million Blackwell/Rubin GPUs, with 6 million already shipped. Vera Rubin is set to launch in the second half of 2026, and a 1GW data center would require around 8,000 VR200 racks, an amount Schafer estimates could represent over $40 billion in DC spend.
		Networking, which accounts for 16% of DC revenue, grew 46% in F2Q and the analyst expects it will rise by 63% in F3Q, driven by NVLink for scale-up and Spectrum-X/Infiniband for scale-out. Networking demand scales with compute. Spectrum-X is already at a $10 billion run rate, and Schafer expects its share to grow as cloud providers favor familiar, reliable, open Ethernet.In Gaming, which accounts for 9% of revenue, Nvidia continues to dominate the high-end segment and has partnered with Intel to develop an x86 SoC integrated with GeForce RTX. Schafer believes the RTX integrated GPU delivers a “higher performance” than Intel’s ARC iGPU, allowing Nvidia to further expand its TAM within the broader PC and notebook space.Meanwhile, ahead of the print, Schafer has raised his EPS forecasts for calendar years 2025, 2026, and 2027 to $4.56, $6.93, and $8.50, respectively, up from $4.55, $6.08, and $7.13.Against this backdrop, Schafer remains a fully-fledged NVDA bull, believing that the company is “best positioned to win in AI.” As he puts it, “NVDA is the undisputed AI leader benefiting from full-stack AI hardware/software and unique rack-scale. AI-led structural growth combined with one of the best GM/OM profiles in the group, we see NVDA’s entrenched DC AI ecosystem core to genAI and remain long-term buyers.”That’s a bullish conclusion, and Schafer backs it up with an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating, while raising his price target from $225 to $265, implying NVDA shares could climb 39% over the one-year timeframe.

		Among Schafer’s colleagues, there’s only very little disagreement with that stance. Based on a mix of 37 Buys vs. 1 Hold and Sell, each, NVDA stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are expected to appreciate by 28% in the months ahead, considering the average price target stands at $240.
