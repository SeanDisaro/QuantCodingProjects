It’s coming, that’s for sure. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is pulling back the curtain on its fourth quarter fiscal year 2026 results tomorrow after the market closes, and the anticipation has reached a fever pitch.The data center leader hasn’t exactly been wowing the market this year, and the performance of its share price has been mostly swimming horizontally. That being said, much of the blame can be cast at forces outside of Nvidia’s control, as macroeconomic worries and clouds bearing down on the AI narrative have been pressuring its share price.The company has a regular history of outperforming the market’s expectations, and if the hyperscaler spending numbers are any indication, it’s about to do so yet again. Will that be enough to help NVDA soar beyond its thus-far lukewarm returns this year?
		As the company gears up to share its progress, investor Bram Berkowitz expects the call to provide “significant insight” into the company’s plans, prospects, and the direction of AI in general.“Earnings reports are always a massive event for Nvidia, as investors view them as a gauge of the entire AI market,” explains the 5-star investor.Specifically, the investor will be looking at three items in particular. The first is the most straightforward, and revolves around data center revenue. Berkowitz notes that the company guided for $65 billion in fourth quarter revenue, and the market will be anxious to learn if the company hit this target.Beyond the black-and-white figure, the investor points out that there will be keen interest in understanding how these sales are breaking down. In particular, Berkowitz wants to know how the thirsty demand for Nvidia’s most powerful GPU, Blackwell, has translated into revenues.The investor will also be closely following management’s “language and excitement” around the next-gen Rubin model. He recalls that the company has forecast a $500 billion opportunity for Blackwell and Rubin through the end of the year.
		Berkowitz will also be paying attention to Nvidia’s “pricing power,” especially as it’s reflected via its operating gross margin. Especially with some of the other hyperscalers seeking to create their own chips, the investor wants to see whether this is impacting Nvidia’s bottom line.And then there’s the China question, which remains a bit of a black box. With much dependent on government decisions in both Washington and Beijing, Berkowitz is curious about “what’s going on?”While nothing’s a given, Berkowitz expects February 25 to be a “huge day” for the company. He’ll be among the many paying rapt attention to the proceedings. (To watch Bram Berkowitz’s track record, click here)Wall Street will surely be paying attention as well. With 31 Buys and 1 Sell, NVDA remains a Strong Buy consensus rating. Its 12-month price target of $267.48 has an upside approaching 40%. (See NVDA stock forecast)
