BlackRock (BLK) has successfully gathered $12.5 billion to fund the massive infrastructure required for the artificial intelligence era. On Thursday, January 15, 2026, the world’s largest asset manager revealed the fundraising progress for its landmark partnership with Microsoft (MSFT). This venture, which focuses on building data centers and new energy sources, aims to capitalize on a technology boom that CEO Larry Fink believes is changing the global economy.The partnership is not just a two-company deal; it includes heavyweights like Nvidia (NVDA) and the Abu Dhabi-backed investment vehicle MGX. While the team is currently aiming for $30 billion in private equity, the use of leverage (essentially taking on debt to amplify buying power) could bring the total investment to $100 billion.The capital for these projects is an important requirement because the physical expense of building AI systems continues to climb. A single state-of-the-art data center can now demand an investment of $40 billion to $50 billion to construct from the ground up. Moving in a new direction, Microsoft and BlackRock are coordinating their massive resources to break the energy bottleneck that currently threatens to stall AI progress in the United States and among its global partners.
		A significant portion of the $12.5 billion raised so far will be funneled into power grids. AI models require an immense amount of electricity, so much so that data centers are projected to consume 4% of global energy by 2029.Fink explained the strategy during the earnings call, suggesting that “Mobilizing private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centers and power will unlock a multi-trillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity.” For investors in BlackRock stock, this shift toward “hard assets” like power plants and transmission lines provides a defensive hedge against the more volatile “software” side of the AI market.Microsoft is currently in a capex arms race with Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL), spending tens of billions of dollars every quarter on its own hardware. By partnering with BlackRock, Microsoft can offload some of the massive financial burden of building physical facilities onto private investors. This allows Microsoft stock to maintain its high margins while still securing the processing power it needs for products like Copilot and Azure AI.For BlackRock, the venture reinforces its dominance in the alternative investment space. Following its acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), BlackRock is now the undisputed leader in private infrastructure, a sector Fink calls the “beginning of a golden age.”Investors can compare both Microsoft and BlackRock’s stocks side-by-side on the TipRanks Stocks Comparison tool.
