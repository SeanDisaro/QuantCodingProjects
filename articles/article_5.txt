Palantir (PLTR) investors gained further evidence that the AI boom is intact. Nvidia’s (NVDA) latest earnings results showed that demand for AI chips and data centers remains strong, reinforcing Palantir’s outlook as businesses continue to adopt advanced AI tools.In fiscal Q2, Nvidia reported revenue of $46.7 billion, up 56% from last year, and adjusted EPS of $1.04, both ahead of Wall Street estimates. Its data center business, the core of AI demand, jumped 56% to $41.1 billion. These results show that spending on AI infrastructure remains resilient, providing a strong backdrop for Palantir’s software business.Against this backdrop, Palantir posted its own record Q2 earlier this month. Revenue climbed 48% to $1 billion, while adjusted EPS jumped 78% to $0.16. Growth was driven by the U.S. commercial unit, where sales soared 93% to $306 million. Meanwhile, contract value for the segment surged 222% to $843 million, while backlog rose 77% to $2.42 billion.
		These numbers highlight that Palantir is not only benefiting from AI interest but also converting it into long-term commitments.Even with strong results, Palantir’s valuation remains a sticking point. Morningstar’s (MORN) Mark Giarelli recently told Bloomberg that while Palantir is “a great company,” its rich valuation “causes heartburn” for investors. Bloomberg Intelligence’s Damian Reimertz added that Palantir would need to generate about $60 billion in revenue over the next year to trade in line with peers, a staggering figure compared to current levels.Still, Palantir CEO Alex Karp has outlined ambitious goals, including plans to grow revenue tenfold in the coming years. And with Nvidia’s results confirming heavy investment in AI infrastructure, Palantir seems well positioned among the software names looking to capitalize on that trend.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on PLTR stock based on five Buys, 13 Holds, and two Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.
