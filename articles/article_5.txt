This article was written by Shalu Saraf and reviewed by Gilan Miller-Gertz.Nvidia (NVDA) is tightening its sales terms in China, asking customers to pay the full amount up front for its H200 AI chips, according to a Reuters report. The move comes as Beijing has yet to clearly approve shipments, creating risk around delivery timelines.Under the new terms, Chinese buyers must pay the full amount upfront when placing an order. Once submitted, orders cannot be canceled, refunded, or changed. In certain cases, customers may use commercial insurance or pledged assets as collateral to secure payment instead of paying the full amount in cash. Nvidia and China’s industry ministry have not commented on the policy yet.
		The tougher terms reflect uncertainty in China’s approval process. While Nvidia has long asked for advance payments from Chinese clients, it previously allowed partial deposits. For the H200, the company is being stricter because it is unclear when regulators will allow shipments.Adding to the delay, Chinese authorities have asked local tech firms to pause new orders for Nvidia’s H200 chips, which Washington recently approved for export to China. Chinese government regulators are deciding how many locally made chips companies must buy along with each H200 order, which has slowed approvals.Despite the hurdles, demand remains strong. Chinese companies have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips, priced at about $27,000 each, far above Nvidia’s current inventory of 700,000 chips.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the H200 chip remains “quite high” and that the company has ramped up its supply chain. Notably, the H200 delivers much stronger performance than the now-blocked H20 and still outperforms most domestic chips for large-scale AI training.Nvidia has reason to be cautious. Last year, the company took a $5.5 billion inventory write-down after a sudden export ban on earlier chips. While U.S. policy now allows H200 sales with a fee paid to Washington, China has since blocked H20 shipments, keeping the risk high.
		By asking for full payment upfront, Nvidia protects itself if approvals are delayed again. The financial risk now sits with buyers, who must commit cash without certainty on delivery.On TipRanks, Nvidia stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating.
