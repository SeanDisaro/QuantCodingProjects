Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance in artificial intelligence (AI) chips positions the stock for strong growth in 2026, following a more than 36% run in 2025. TipRanks AI analyst, based on Perplexity’s SonarPro AI model, rates NVDA as “Outperform” with an 84 score, highlighting Nvidia as a reliable AI powerhouse. The AI analyst assigns a $218 price target, implying 18.92% upside from current levels around $184.The stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) of 45.5x, which is about 83% higher than the sector average of 24.8x but roughly 25% below Nvidia’s own five-year average. Yet, investors are paying a premium for Nvidia amid robust sales growth, with revenue reaching $57 billion in Q3 FY26. TipRanks data also shows a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from Wall Street analysts and a 42% upward potential.AI Analyst attributes the high score to a mix of positive and negative factors. On the positive side, Nvidia continues to deliver substantial revenue growth from AI chip demand, strengthening its market position and global reach. The chip giant has forged several strategic partnerships, including with OpenAI to deploy 10 gigawatts of advanced systems, Synopsys (SNPS), Microsoft (MSFT), Anthropic, Palantir (PLTR), and CrowdStrike (CRWD). Also, its strong cash flow funds R&D spending and serves as a buffer against market downturns, supporting dividends and buybacks.
		On the other hand, Nvidia faces continued geopolitical challenges in China that threaten its access to a vital market for data-center products, potentially limiting revenue growth. The company also faces high inventory levels, signaling possible supply-chain issues that could strain resources and compress profitability if not addressed swiftly.Despite the challenges, Wall Street analysts remain highly optimistic about Nvidia’s long-term outlook. On TipRanks, Nvidia has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating. The average Nvidia price target of $263.44 implies 42.5% upside potential from current levels.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
