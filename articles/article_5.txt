Vertiv Holdings (VRT) is scheduled to announce its results for the fourth quarter of 2025 on Wednesday, February 11. VRT stock has surged 24% so far in 2026 and 60% over the past year, driven by strong demand for the company’s power and cooling solutions for data centers amid the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) wave. According to TipRanks’ Options Tool, options traders expect a 9.41% move in either direction in VRT stock in reaction to Q4 2025 earnings.  This implied move is higher than Vertiv stock’s average post-earnings move (in absolute terms) of 5.31% over the past four quarters.Wall Street expects Vertiv to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.29, reflecting 30.3% year-over-year growth. Revenue is projected to grow by about 23% to $2.88 billion. The company ended Q3 2025 with a strong backlog of $9.5 billion. Investors will look forward to management’s commentary about the demand backdrop and an update on the backlog.
		Investors will also await updates on the company’s EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) business, which has been under pressure and underperforming the Americas and APAC (Asia Pacific) segments due to power availability and regulatory challenges.As seen in the chart below, revenue from Vertiv’s Americas and APAC segments grew by 42.9% and 20.2% year over year, respectively, while EMEA revenue increased by only 0.2%.In its Q3 earnings release, the company said that it has accelerated its restructuring program in EMEA and expects the market conditions in the region to improve in the second half of 2026.Ahead of Q4 earnings, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated a Buy rating on Vertiv stock with a price target of $210. The 5-star analyst expects Vertiv to deliver a modest revenue upside for Q4 2025, driven by robust AI data center infrastructure demand and increased wallet share.While tariffs remain a near-term headwind, Daryanani expects margins to stabilize at about 25% over the long term, supported by the company’s productivity initiatives and pricing actions. Also, the analyst expects Vertiv’s partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) and demand from neo-cloud and sovereign cloud customers to sustain backlog growth, exceeding long-term revenue targets.
		Last month, Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell upgraded Vertiv Holdings to Buy from Hold and increased the price target to $200 from $181. While Barclays has not been “among the Datacenter capex theme’s biggest cheerleaders,” Mitchell noted that the recent volatility in VRT stock has created a buying opportunity. The analyst highlighted Vertiv’s revenue exposure to data centers, noting that about 80% of the company’s sales come from that end market, the highest level among U.S. multi-industry companies in its coverage.Mitchell noted that Vertiv’s organic sales growth has “tracked closely” with U.S. data center physical infrastructure trends and has surpassed the multi-industry average in recent years. He expects organic sales growth to remain elevated through 2026 and 2027.TipRanks’ AI Analyst has an Outperform rating on Vertiv stock with a price target of $211, indicating 5.3% upside potential.
