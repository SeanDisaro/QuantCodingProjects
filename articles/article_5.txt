Tesla’s (TSLA) stock is currently being pulled in opposite directions, as Wall Street sells while retail investors continue to buy. Unsurprisingly, many of the worries stem from Tesla’s slowing automotive business, which still generates about 90% of revenue, as well as its long-term bets on AI and autonomous driving. As a result, large funds appear to be reducing exposure, while individual investors are using the pullback as a buying opportunity.Indeed, according to Quiver Quantitative, several major firms cut their positions sharply in the fourth quarter. For example, UBS (UBS) Asset Management reduced its stake by about 59 million shares to just over 20 million shares valued at nearly $9.1 billion. Meanwhile, Nomura (NMR) sold more than 80% of its holdings by unloading nearly 5 million shares. Goldman Sachs (GS) also trimmed its holdings by more than 2.4 million shares, though it still owns over 27 million shares worth about $12.2 billion, while Morgan Stanley (MS) reduced its position for a third straight quarter to roughly 35.8 million shares.However, retail investors have moved in the opposite direction. In fact, JPMorgan (JPM) data shows that individuals bought about $326 million worth of Tesla stock during the week of February 12–18, making it one of their top purchases behind only Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). Analysts also noted that retail traders have continued adding to major tech names despite uncertainty, with Tesla ranking second only to Microsoft in year-to-date retail inflows.
