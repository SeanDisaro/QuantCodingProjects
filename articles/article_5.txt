Nvidia (NVDA) will report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 results on February 25, and it has just received a more bullish call from Wall Street, with one analyst saying the company could beat expectations on multiple fronts.Aletheia Capital analyst Stefan Chang upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold and set a $250 price target, implying about 32% upside from current levels. He expects Nvidia’s fiscal Q4 earnings and its fiscal Q1 2027 outlook to both come in above Wall Street estimates. A strong report and guidance could ease slowdown fears and refocus investors on AI infrastructure growth.Until recently, the main debate around Nvidia was not demand but timing. Investors were worried about rising inventory levels, both on the company’s balance sheet and across its distribution channels, along with the gradual deployment of large rack-scale AI systems.
		Those concerns had kept the firm cautious. Now Chang believes the situation is improving.The analyst expects inventory levels to normalize starting in fiscal Q4 2026 as module production strengthens and rack shipments accelerate. In other words, installations appear to be catching up with orders, suggesting the issue was slower system deployment, not weak customer demand.The upgrade also reflects the wider boom in AI spending. Chang expects total spending on computing power to rise about 75% from last year to nearly $530 billion. He also forecasts Nvidia’s data-center revenue to reach roughly $475 billion across fiscal Q3 2026 through Q4 2027, broadly aligned with the company’s longer-term outlook.On TipRanks, Nvidia stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 31 Buys and one Sell rating. The average Nvidia price target of $265.63 implies 39.94% upside potential from current levels.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
