Nvidia (NVDA) is still growing, but its stock price has stalled. Top Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said that mismatch has pushed the stock to levels that now look unusually cheap. The 5-star analyst kept his Outperform rating and a $275 price target, and said clearly: “We would be buyers here.”Rasgon explained that while Nvidia shares are up about 30% this year, the stock has stalled since July as other chip stocks kept rising. With earnings forecasts still moving higher, that pause has pushed Nvidia’s valuation down to just under 25 times forward earnings, after a 27% multiple drop this year.The analyst said that number matters because Nvidia rarely trades at these levels. Based on the last ten years, the stock has almost never traded this cheap. In fact, today’s valuation puts Nvidia in the bottom 11% of its historical range.
		The comparison looks even more striking against other chip stocks. Nvidia now trades at about a 13% discount to the semiconductor index. Rasgon noted that over the last decade, there have been only 13 days when Nvidia traded cheaper than this relative to the broader chip sector.So why has the stock lagged? Rasgon said investors are worried about a slowdown in AI spending, long-term capital plans, and rising competition from custom chips. He believes these concerns are being overstated.He said current spending plans still look solid, and demand for Nvidia’s GPUs remains healthy. At the same time, Nvidia’s next-generation platform, Rubin, is moving closer, with upcoming events such as CES and GTC likely to refocus attention on the product roadmap. Rasgon also pointed to possible upside if H200 sales to China receive approval.Looking ahead, Rasgon added that expectations still appear low when compared with Nvidia’s long-term Blackwell and Rubin opportunity, which management has said could exceed $500 billion.Overall, the analyst believes Nvidia’s strong business and reset valuation make the stock attractive at current levels.
		Wall Street feels much the same way about Nvidia. With 40 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell, NVDA enjoys a Strong Buy consensus rating. Nvidia’s 12-month average price target of $259.23 implies almost 48.87% upside potential.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
