Nvidia (NVDA) will report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 results on February 25, and investors are watching closely for what the company says about demand for AI chips. After a year in which its processors helped lift much of the market, traders want to know whether large cloud companies are still spending heavily on AI data centers. The company’s comments could affect not only Nvidia’s stock but also the mood across the broader tech sector.Nvidia is the leading supplier of chips used to train and run AI systems. Because of this role, investors often treat its guidance as a signal for broader AI spending, not just a company-specific update.Over the past year, Nvidia’s results have repeatedly exceeded forecasts, helped by tight supply of AI chips and aggressive spending by large cloud providers.
		The upcoming report matters because comparisons are becoming harder and investors want to know whether that pace of growth can continue.In particular, attention will center on the rollout of Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell platform. Analysts are watching shipment timing, production capacity, and customer demand, as these factors will influence revenue growth over the coming quarters.Wall Street expects another strong report, with earnings and revenue projected to rise sharply from a year ago. Data-center products, which include the company’s AI accelerators, continue to be the main growth driver.For Q4, analysts expect Nvidia to post adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.52, up nearly 71% from the year-ago figure of $0.89. Moreover, sales are forecast to jump 67% year-over-year to $65.56 billion.For this report, investors will pay close attention to management’s outlook. They will listen for updates on orders from large cloud customers, spending plans, and whether companies building AI systems are still expanding capacity.
		If Nvidia indicates that demand remains strong, it would support the view that the AI build-out is still in its early stages. However, any signs of slower orders or delayed deployments could raise concerns that expectations have moved ahead of reality.As a result, the report is being watched beyond the company itself. Many investors now see Nvidia as a gauge for AI spending, so its comments could influence sentiment across the wider technology sector.On TipRanks, Nvidia stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating. The average Nvidia price target of $260.38 implies 39.29% upside potential from current levels.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
