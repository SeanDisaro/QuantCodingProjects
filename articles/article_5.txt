Nvidia (NVDA) stock climbed nearly 35% over the past year, pushing its market cap to nearly $4.6 trillion. Investors now wonder about the company’s path by decade’s end. Will intensifying competition or sales hits from China export bans stall Nvidia’s momentum? The outlook remains promising if Nvidia sustains its market dominance and keeps rolling out cutting-edge AI products, as it did at the recent CES 2026 event.Nvidia made several key AI-focused announcements at CES 2026 during CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote. The most noteworthy was Alpamayo, an open-source AI model for self-driving cars that enables human-like thinking to reason, predict, and navigate in tough conditions. The semiconductor giant also launched upgrades to its Vera CPU and Rubin GPU, boosting single-threaded speed, memory size, and data center power. Importantly, Nvidia confirmed that production of its next-gen Rubin architecture is proceeding at full speed.Over the past decade, Nvidia delivered over 23,000% growth as AI shifted from hype to reality. A $1,000 investment on December 31, 2015, would now be worth about $231,000.
		The AI market continues expanding with fresh products and applications. Nvidia has also evolved from a gaming-focused GPU maker to the go-to provider of parallel processors powering AI, launching innovations at a steady clip. Hyperscalers’ huge AI bets have not yet fully paid off, and tech giants envision AI automating routine tasks across industries over the coming years.Nvidia’s impressive past growth may not persist indefinitely at the same pace, as mature businesses typically see their expansion rates slow over time. In the quarter ended October 26, 2025, total revenue topped $50 billion for the first time, driven by $51.2 billion in Data Center sales, showing a 66% year-over-year jump.Nvidia captures a large share of Big Tech’s AI budgets. Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) were expected to spend $600 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, with outlays rising in 2026 and beyond. Nvidia is expected to claim about $200 billion of those budgets.Nvidia forecasts $3 trillion to $4 trillion in global data center capex by 2030. Even if rivals grab a slice, $600 billion in revenue seems largely achievable. Nvidia’s current 50% profit margins translate to $300 billion in net income, and applying a 33x earnings multiple points to a $10 trillion market cap.Nvidia trades around $189 per share today ($4.60 trillion market cap). Reaching $10 trillion by 2030 requires $410 per share, suggesting a 117% upside potential. A leading Wall Street analyst, Mark Lipacis of Evercore ISI, already projects a $352 price target over the next twelve months. This simply shows us that $410 is not a pipe dream.
		Analysts are highly optimistic about Nvidia’s growth ahead. Their average Nvidia price target of $263.76 implies 39.5% upside potential from current levels over the next twelve months.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
