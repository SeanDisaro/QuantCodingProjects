Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) is taking another step in artificial intelligence, this time focused on inference, where AI models give answers to users. On Wednesday, Nvidia said it will license chip technology from AI startup Groq and hire several senior leaders from the company, including founder Jonathan Ross and President Sunny Madra. Financial details were not shared.The deal is a “non-exclusive” license, so Groq can still work with other partners. Groq said it will continue to run as a separate company. Simon Edwards will take over as CEO, and the company’s cloud business will continue.Groq builds inference chips designed for speed. Its chips use on-chip memory instead of external high-bandwidth memory, which helps AI systems respond faster. This limits the size of models that can run on the chips, but it allows quicker responses as AI tools see wider use.
		The design has drawn interest as companies look for faster and lower-cost ways to run AI applications. Meanwhile, Groq’s valuation has risen sharply this year, showing growing demand for alternatives in inference.Nvidia’s deal with Groq reflects a wider shift across Big Tech. Instead of full takeovers, companies are choosing licensing deals and direct leadership hires. This helps them bring in new technology and talent without the extra regulatory scrutiny that often comes with buying a company.In recent examples, Microsoft (MSFT) brought in its top AI executive through a $650 million licensing deal, while Meta Platforms (META) spent $15 billion to hire Scale AI’s CEO without buying the firm. Amazon (AMZN) hired founders from Adept AI, and Nvidia earlier invested $900 million to hire AI hardware startup Enfabrica’s CEO Rochan Sankar and his team, while also licensing its technology.Regulators have reviewed these deals, but none have been stopped so far.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on NVDA stock based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average NVDA price target of $263.58 per share implies 39.8% upside potential.
