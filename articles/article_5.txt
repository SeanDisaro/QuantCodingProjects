Catch up on the top industries and stocks that were impacted, or were predicted to be impacted, by the comments, actions and policies of President Donald Trump with this daily recap compiled by The Fly.HEADING TO IRAN: In a post on Truth Social, President Trump stated, “A massive Armada is heading to Iran. It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose. It is a larger fleet, headed by the great Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln, than that sent to Venezuela. Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary. Hopefully Iran will quickly “Come to the Table” and negotiate a fair and equitable deal – NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS – one that is good for all parties. Time is running out, it is truly of the essence! As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL! They didn’t, and there was “Operation Midnight Hammer,” a major destruction of Iran. The next attack will be far worse! Don’t make that happen again. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DONALD J. TRUMP”H200 CHIPS: China has approved the purchase of Nvidia’s (NVDA) H200 AI chips for the first time, authorizing several Chinese customers, including Alibaba (BABA) and ByteDance, to buy an initial batch worth about $10B, The Wall Street Journal’s Raffaele Huang reports.

		LINKS TO ICE LIST: Meta (META) has begun to block users on its social media platforms from sharing links to website ICE List, which has compiled names of what it says are Department of Homeland Security staff, Wired’s David Gilbert reports. Dominick Skinner, the creator of the site he says is meant to hold such employees accountable, told Wired that links to the site have been shared without issue on Meta’s platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, for over six months. “I think it’s no surprise that a company run by a man who sat behind Trump at his inauguration, and donated to the destruction of the White House, has taken a stance that helps ICE agents retain anonymity,” Skinner told Wired. KIDS ACCOUNTS: JPMorgan Chase (JPM) announced it will match the U.S. government’s one-time $1,000 contribution to children of eligible U.S. employees, providing an additional $1,000 per eligible child. The children’s retirement savings account program, known as “Trump Accounts,” provides a $1,000 pilot contribution from the U.S. Treasury into a tax-advantaged account for eligible children born in the U.S. between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2028. The program is designed to help build long-term financial security for millions of children by encouraging saving and investing from day one. “JPMorganChase has demonstrated a long-term commitment to the financial health and well-being of all of our employees and their families around the world, including more than 190,000 here in the United States,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorganChase. “By matching this contribution, we’re making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely, and plan for their family’s financial future.” This year, the firm granted a special award of $1,000 to eligible employees globally earning less than $80,000 in total annual cash compensation, and deposited the funds into employees’ 401(k) accounts in the U.S.Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
