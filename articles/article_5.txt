Global stocks entered 2026 with strong gains as AI spending stayed high and rate cuts stayed in place. In the U.S., large tech firms drove much of the market rise, with AI-tied names leading returns. At the same time, bonds also rallied as inflation eased and investors priced in easier policy.However, this setup carries a risk that markets may be missing. AI is no longer just a growth story. It is also becoming a key driver of costs across chips, power, labor, and capital. Due to these factors, inflation may stay higher for longer, which could limit further rate cuts.This matters because much of the AI rally depends on low rates. When rates fall, future earnings look more valuable today. When inflation rises, central banks slow or stop cuts. That shift can quickly change how investors value AI stocks.
		Large AI investors are now spending at a scale that affects the broader economy. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and Amazon (AMZN) are expected to spend more than $400 billion in 2026 on data centers, chips, and power. That figure is higher than in 2025 and continues to inflate.At the company level, revenue growth remains strong. However, costs are rising faster in many cases. Chip prices are increasing, power contracts are getting more expensive, and depreciation is climbing as firms buy short-life assets like GPUs.Oracle Corporation (ORCL), for example, saw its shares fall after the company lifted its spending plans and reported weaker free cash flow. Broadcom (AVGO) also warned that AI demand could pressure margins, which led to a sharp stock drop. Alphabet said higher capital spending is already weighing on profit, as depreciation jumped by $5 billion in one quarter.Meanwhile, HP (HPQ) expects higher memory costs to hit pricing and profit in late 2026. Memory accounts for about 15% to 18% of a personal computer’s cost, so even small price changes matter.As AI spending grows, it also lifts demand for power and labor. Data centers now compete with homes and factories for electricity. Analysts expect global data center power use to rise sharply through 2030, which adds pressure to energy prices.
		As a result, several firms expect U.S. inflation to remain above the Federal Reserve’s target through 2027. If that view proves right, central banks may pause or even reverse rate cuts. That would raise funding costs and lower the value investors place on future earnings.For AI stocks, this creates a clear link between inflation and valuation. Strong sales alone may not be enough if rates stay high. Investors will likely focus more on cash flow, margins, and return on spending.In short, AI growth remains real. However, the market test in 2026 may center less on demand and more on disciplineUsing TipRanks’ Comparison Tool, we’ve lined up and compared all the major AI spenders appearing in the piece, alongside other notable players in the AI industry.
