AI chip stocks remain in focus as investors look for the next winner in the fast-growing data center and accelerator market. After reviewing long-term AI demand and chip builds through 2028, top Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis offered a clear view on NVIDIA (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) — and picked a favorite.It is worth noting that Curtis ranks 62 out of more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. He has a success rate of 65%, with an average return per rating of 30.40% over a one-year timeframe.The five-star analyst said Broadcom remains his “Top Pick” in the AI space. The firm now models Broadcom’s earnings above $19 by 2028, with a longer-term view that earnings could reach $25 per share under conservative assumptions.
		Jefferies sees Broadcom as a key winner from custom AI chips and large cloud customers. The analyst pointed to strong demand tied to major platforms, including projects linked to OpenAI and Meta (META), as drivers that could support earnings growth over several years.While Broadcom holds the top spot, Jefferies also turned more positive on Nvidia. Curtis raised his price target on Nvidia to $275 from $250 and kept a Buy rating.He said Nvidia still looks cheap relative to its growth outlook. Based on Jefferies’ estimates, the stock is trading at a mid-teens multiple on expected 2027 earnings. Jefferies expects Nvidia to keep beating earnings expectations and see estimates rise over time, even if the increases are not as large as Broadcom’s.Jefferies also shared a constructive view on AMD. Curtis expects strong GPU server growth through the year, driven by overall AI market expansion and potential share gains.While AMD is not the top pick, Jefferies believes the company can benefit as more customers look for alternatives in the AI chip space, especially as demand spreads beyond a single supplier.
		The TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool shows that analysts have assigned a “Strong Buy” consensus rating on three stocks, with NVDA offering the highest upside potential over the next twelve months.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
