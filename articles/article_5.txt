OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is reportedly considering relocating from California as political and regulatory scrutiny intensifies around its plan to shift into a for-profit structure. The move, though still a fallback option, underscores the mounting challenges the AI company faces in balancing growth ambitions with state regulations.For context, OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015 and later created a for-profit subsidiary to raise billions from Microsoft (MSFT) and investors, fueling its AI development. In late 2024, OpenAI announced plans to convert the subsidiary into an independent for-profit company, sparking significant criticism.According to the Wall Street Journal, the pressure is building as some of California’s largest philanthropies, nonprofits, and labor groups unite to challenge OpenAI’s restructuring plan. These groups are urging the state attorney general to ensure that any new for-profit entity does not violate California’s charitable trust laws.
		Adding to the tension, attorneys general in both California and Delaware are now reviewing the proposed changes. These regulators are tasked with protecting charities in their states and hold the authority to sue OpenAI for potential nonprofit law violations or impose a settlement as a condition for moving forward with the restructuring.If OpenAI fails to restructure, it could face serious setbacks. The current nonprofit-controlled setup limits its ability to raise money or pursue a public listing. CEO Sam Altman and backers argue that a for-profit model is essential.In fact, investors have tied about $19 billion in funding, nearly half of OpenAI’s capital raised over the past year, to this shift. Without the restructuring, investors may walk away, threatening the company’s plans to build massive data centers, develop custom chips, and keep leading AI innovation.Meanwhile, the Financial Times recently reported that OpenAI’s corporate restructuring will likely be delayed until next year, as the company continues negotiations over key terms of its partnership with Microsoft. The delay could complicate its plans to raise billions in additional funding.Additionally, OpenAI is also facing a lawsuit from Elon Musk, which seeks to block the for-profit conversion, claiming it violates OpenAI’s nonprofit mission. The case is expected to go to trial next year, though OpenAI maintains that the lawsuit is baseless and without merit.
