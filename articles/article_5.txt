Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is expanding its global partnership with Cohere, a security-first enterprise AI company. The key focus is on integrating AMD’s AI chips into Cohere’s suite of large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP) tools. With this move, the companies aim to accelerate the deployment and performance of enterprise AI solutions.Another key part of the deal is helping businesses and governments build sovereign AI systems, especially in Canada and across the globe.The collaboration involves making AMD Instinct GPU infrastructure accessible to Cohere’s enterprise customers. This integration will support the Nvidia (NVDA)-backed AI startup Cohere’s full range of AI offerings.
		This builds on previous optimization work for Cohere’s enterprise LLMs and provides the high memory bandwidth needed to handle complex, long-form tasks. This will help lower the total cost of ownership (TCO) for customers.Beyond offering solutions to external clients, AMD will integrate Cohere’s North AI platform directly into its own enterprise AI portfolio. This makes Cohere’s technology a key part of AMD’s internal and engineering AI workloads.Finally, by combining Cohere’s highly secure and private AI models with AMD’s high-performance AI infrastructure, the deal aims to support governments and enterprises in building sovereign AI systems that meet strict national data, security, and compliance rules.Turning to Wall Street, AMD stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys and 13 Holds assigned in the last three months. At $187.73, the average AMD price target implies a 17.6% upside potential.See more AMD analyst ratings
