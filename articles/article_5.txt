Nvidia (NVDA) said via X: “We’ve seen erroneous chatter in the media claiming that NVIDIA is supply constrained and ‘sold out’ of H100/H200. As we noted at earnings, our cloud partners can rent every H100/H200 they have online – but that doesn’t mean we’re unable to fulfill new orders. We have more than enough H100/H200 to satisfy every order without delay. The rumor that H20 reduced our supply of either H100/H200 or Blackwell is also categorically false – selling H20 has no impact on our ability to supply other NVIDIA products.”Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
