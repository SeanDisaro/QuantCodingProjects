Nvidia (NVDA) stock has been declining since the company reported its Q2 earnings results on August 27. Revenues reached a record $46.7 billion, beating the analysts’ estimates of $46.05 billion. Also, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.04, above analysts’ consensus estimate of $1.01 per share. Despite delivering stronger-than-expected results, NVDA shares pulled back. Still, Top Wall Street analysts remain bullish and have raised their price targets to reflect continued demand for the company’s AI chips.Following NVDA’s latest quarterly report, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh raised his price target on the stock to $230 from $215 while maintaining a Buy rating. The 5-star analyst noted that fiscal Q2 results came in slightly ahead of consensus, with fiscal Q3 guidance landing well above expectations.Still, Data Center revenue was a soft spot, as Compute was flat quarter-over-quarter, though Networking rose 46%. Vinh highlighted that guidance excludes revenue from China, which could add another $2–$5 billion in fiscal Q3 if more licenses are granted. With stronger guidance and the ramp-up of the GB300/B300 platform—expected to drive “tens of billions” in potential revenue—he modestly raised estimates and lifted his price target.
		Mizuho’s Top analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated an Outperform rating on the stock. He emphasized Nvidia’s dominant role in AI training and inference chips, where the company controls more than 95% of the Data Center market. Rakesh expects this market to grow at a 60% CAGR to more than $500 billion by 2028.Beyond Data Center strength, he sees healthy momentum in Gaming, where Nvidia maintains more than 75% PC market share. He also cited growth opportunities in automotive and the upcoming upgrade cycle with the RTX 50-series. Rakesh noted that China export restrictions remain a headwind but described the impact as “muted” given strong demand elsewhere.Truist analyst William Stein raised his price target on Nvidia to $228 from $210 and kept a Buy rating. While sales and guidance were slightly below what some investors expected, Stein called this a “minor imperfection” and focused on the bigger picture.He noted that Nvidia’s new Vera-Rubin chip is on track for 2026, and management suggested growth could reach about 50% next year, well above Wall Street’s current forecasts. Nvidia also pointed to the AI infrastructure market growing nearly 50% per year, reaching as much as $3–$4 trillion by 2030. Stein lifted his 2026 EPS estimate to $6.50 from $5.99, adding that Nvidia remains “the AI company.”Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on NVDA stock based on 36 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Further, the average NVDA price target of $199.94 per share implies 10.10% upside potential.
