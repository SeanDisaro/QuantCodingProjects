Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), NEOS Nasdaq-100 High Income ETF (QQQI), and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) all pay investors cash, but they generate that income in different ways. SCHD pays dividends from the companies it owns, while QQQI produces most of its payouts using an options strategy. VOO tracks the broad market, and its distributions come from the regular dividends paid by large S&P 500 (SPX) companies rather than from an income-focused strategy.For income investors, the key measure is dividend yield — the cash paid relative to the fund’s price. Currently, QQQI offers a yield of roughly 13%–14%, SCHD yields about 3%–4%, while VOO yields around 1%–1.5%.Using the TipRanks’ ETF Comparison Tool, we have placed SCHD, QQQI, and VOO ETFs against each other to find the best dividend ETF for investors in 2026.
