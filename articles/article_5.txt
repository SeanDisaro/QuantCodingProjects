Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock slipped on Wednesday despite the launch of its Redstone technology for graphics processing units (GPUs). This new technology adds machine learning (ML) frame generation to the company’s Radeon RX 9000-series GPUs with RDNA 4 graphics architecture.A big focus of the Redstone update is artificial intelligence (AI)-powered frame generation, which can allow for higher framerates and clearer visuals in games. This is an update that AMD announced in February to help it compete against Nvidia (NVDA) GPUs, which already have similar technology in the GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards through DLSS 4.AMD Redstone launched with support for more than 200 games, though only about 40 of those support frame generation. More support will be added over time, and game developers are already expected to utilize the technology for 2026 releases. This will allow for better integration of Redstone frame generation into those titles.
