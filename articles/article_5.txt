Shares of Oracle (ORCL) are surging today after investment firm D.A. Davidson, led by four-star analyst Gil Luria, upgraded the tech stock from Hold to Buy while keeping its $180 price target unchanged. The move suggests that some of the uncertainty surrounding Oracle is starting to clear. More specifically, the firm sees improving conditions around Oracle’s AI-related partnerships, which had previously weighed on the stock. As those concerns ease, analysts believe that investor confidence could begin to return.Notably, most of the optimism is thanks to OpenAI, which D.A. Davidson says is refocusing on its core frontier models and ChatGPT while scaling back on less important projects. This shift, the firm argues, should help OpenAI better meet its commitments this year, including those tied to Oracle. Importantly, analysts said that OpenAI’s recent behavior had weighed on stocks across its ecosystem, including Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), CoreWeave (CRWV), and especially Oracle. Now, however, they argue that OpenAI appears more willing to “align” with its major partners rather than compete with them directly.As a result, D.A. Davidson expects that as investors regain confidence in OpenAI’s long-term outlook, the public companies connected to it could see meaningful valuation upside. At the same time, Oracle shared a positive business update by saying that its cloud infrastructure operations in India have doubled over the past two years, according to BW Businessworld. Indeed, company executives pointed to strong demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure from organizations that are running mission-critical workloads.
