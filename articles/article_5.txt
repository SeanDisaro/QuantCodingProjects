While speaking during the company’s AI and Autonomy Day, Rivian (RIVN) CEO RJ Scaringe stated: “At the core of this platform, our first in-house Rivian autonomy processor. Now, the first iteration of our in-house inference platform includes a neural engine with 800 tops. It’s optimized to support camera centric AI in the physical world, and enables a dramatic expansion of Rivian’s autonomy capabilities. When integrated into what we call our Gen three autonomy compute platform, which video will go through later in detail, it will deliver 1600 tops. The effectiveness and efficiency of our in-house processor has been a core focus in its development. Our Gen three computer is capable of processing 5 billion pixels per second. Now, you’ve heard me say this a couple of times. We’ve designed this entire architecture around an AI centric approach where the data flywheel of our deployed fleet helps the model get better and better through reinforcement learning. Not only does this sensor set enable a much higher ceiling than what we have on our vehicles today. It also makes the platform much better to serve in building our model. We’re going to continue to see improvements on our platform later.”Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
