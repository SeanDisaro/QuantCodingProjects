The S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.26%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose 0.09%, and the Russell 2000 (IWM) added 0.54%. Seven of eleven sectors finished higher, led by Consumer Discretionary stocks, while Utilities lagged.The main story of the week came from Washington and Beijing, as U.S. President Donald Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two reached a temporary trade truce focused on rare earth exports. China agreed to delay new export controls for one year, while the U.S. paused plans to expand its export blacklist.The deal was presented as a win for both sides, but details remain scarce. U.S. officials said the agreement may ease near-term pressure on supply chains for critical minerals used in semiconductors, fighter jets, and electric cars. Still, analysts cautioned that existing Chinese controls are unchanged, meaning producers remain dependent on Beijing for key materials.
