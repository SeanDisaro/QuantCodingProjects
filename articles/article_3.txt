		The story of the week was the pullback in major technology names after a strong year of gains. Nvidia (NVDA) fell 1.81%, its worst month since 2022, as investors rotated away from high-growth stocks. The decline followed reports that Meta Platforms (META) may buy AI chips from Alphabet (GOOGL) instead of Nvidia, sparking talk that Nvidia’s market dominance could face its first real test.Meanwhile, Alphabet climbed 13.8% for the month after revealing its upgraded Gemini 3 AI model and a potential new chip deal with Meta. Broadcom (AVGO) also gained 7.6% on expectations it will benefit from demand tied to Google’s AI projects. However, investors grew more selective, with many looking to take profits from names that led the 2025 rally.The rotation weighed on the broader AI trade, but it also reflected healthy rebalancing. Analysts said investors are adjusting to the idea that AI spending growth may spread to more firms and chip designs. The shift helped steady markets as traders prepared for what some call a “Santa Claus rally” fueled by rate-cut expectations.Defense startup Anduril grabbed headlines after a Wall Street Journal report said its autonomous drone systems failed multiple field tests. The company, founded by Palmer Luckey and backed by Peter Thiel, said the issues were part of its “fail fast” approach to innovation. Still, the news raised fresh questions about the reliability of AI weapons systems in active use.Another major story centered on OpenAI’s financing model. The Financial Times reported that partners, including Oracle (ORCL), SoftBank (SFTBY), CoreWeave (CRWV), Crusoe, and Blue Owl Capital (OBDC), are collectively taking on about $100 billion in debt to fund OpenAI’s massive infrastructure projects. Oracle’s stock fell 1.49% on the news, as investors grew wary of rising costs linked to AI data centers. Analysts noted that OpenAI’s strategy of “leveraging other balance sheets” could put pressure on partners even as the company expands globally.
		Meanwhile, GameStop (GME) made a surprise comeback, rising more than 3% after Michael Burry shared old letters and emails from his time investing in the retailer. The nostalgic posts reignited chatter among retail traders, making GameStop one of the most mentioned tickers on social media. Still, analysts said the move had little to do with fundamentals.Intel (INTC) was the standout among large-cap stocks, gaining over 10% for the week as investors welcomed signs of renewed strength in the chipmaker’s PC business. Other gainers included Moderna (MRNA), SanDisk (SNDK), and Western Digital (WDC), each rising between 3% and 4%.Looking ahead, attention turns to the Federal Reserve’s December policy meeting, where traders now see an 80% chance of a quarter-point rate cut. Investors will also watch for November jobs data and updates from the manufacturing sector for clues on the strength of the economy heading into 2026.With inflation cooling and borrowing costs easing, analysts expect continued support for equities into year-end. However, as the AI trade resets and market leadership shifts, volatility may stay elevated. For now, the market mood appears steady, with investors cautiously optimistic that the next Fed move could mark the start of a softer monetary path.The earnings calendar stays active this week, with software, cybersecurity, and retail names taking center stage as the final wave of November results rolls in.
		On Tuesday, Salesforce (CRM) will headline after the close, with investors watching for updates on enterprise software demand and margins following steady growth in cloud revenue. Snowflake (SNOW) will also report, with Wall Street focusing on consumption trends across data analytics workloads.
