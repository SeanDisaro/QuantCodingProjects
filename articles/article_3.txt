Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is making a big move into one of the world’s fastest-growing tech markets. The company announced a new deal with Tata Consultancy Services (IN:TCS) to build large-scale AI systems in India. This partnership uses AMD’s Helios plan, which is a pre-made setup designed to help Indian businesses and the government set up AI hubs quickly. By working with the biggest IT firm in the country, AMD wants to be the main alternative to Nvidia (NVDA) as India tries to build its own independent computing power.The main part of this news is the AMD Helios platform. This system is a specialized setup built to handle the heavy work of modern AI. It uses Instinct MI455X GPUs and new EPYC Venice CPUs to run very large AI models. The shared plan can handle up to 200 megawatts of power, which is enough to run major national projects. Additionally, the system runs on the open ROCm software, which AMD says is more flexible and cheaper than Nvidia’s private software. This setup is made to keep companies from getting stuck with just one brand, which is a big selling point for Indian firms that want more than one supplier.
		The chip market is changing, and new data shows that Nvidia’s total control is starting to slip. Reports from Arista Networks (ANET) show that AMD now makes up about 20% to 25% of new AI chip setups. This is a huge jump from last year when Nvidia controlled almost 99% of the market. More companies are choosing AMD hardware for inference, the part where the AI actually answers questions, because it often gives better results for the price than more expensive options.India is the perfect place for this growth because it often skips old technology to use the newest tools. The country famously missed out on landline phones and went straight to being a mobile leader with nearly a billion smartphones. Today, India is third in the world for AI strength, behind only the U.S. and China. The government has already put over $1.2 billion into building local computer power, making the AMD-Tata deal a key part of India’s plan to lead its own digital future.To sum up, AMD is no longer just the second-place chip company. For a long time, Nvidia was the only real choice if you wanted to build an AI center, but those days are ending. Using a pre-made plan with Tata makes it very simple for Indian companies to pick AMD over Nvidia.Turning to Wall Street, AMD stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys and nine Holds assigned in the last three months. At $286.80, the average AMD price target implies a 38.3% upside potential.
