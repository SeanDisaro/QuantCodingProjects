A severe shortage in DRAM chips is pushing memory prices to record highs. The trend is forcing companies that build laptops and smartphones to cut memory in new models, even as demand stays strong. Contract prices for 16Gb DDR5 chips have jumped nearly 300% in three months, climbing from around $6.84 in September to $27.20 in December 2025.According to the specialized tech sector research group, TrendForce, companies such as Dell Technologies (DELL) and Lenovo Group (LNVGY) plan to reduce RAM from 16GB to 8GB in new mid-range laptops starting in 2026. Smaller builders like Paradox Customs are taking more extreme steps. Some of their desktop builds now ship without memory at all, leaving users to source RAM themselves.The smartphone market is also under pressure. Entry-level devices are expected to drop from 6GB or 8GB of RAM down to 4GB. Mid-tier phones could be limited to 6GB or 8GB instead of the 12GB setups seen in current models. IDC expects this shortage to stretch into 2027. However, some manufacturers say the problem could last until 2028.
		The main issue is that chipmakers are shifting factory space toward high-bandwidth memory, or HBM. That type of memory is used in AI data centers. It sells at a much higher price than standard DRAM. Companies such as Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) and SK Hynix have reported that their 2026 memory supply is already sold out.As a result, costs are rising fast. The price of a 12GB LPDDR5X chip used in Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 17 Pro has more than doubled this year. At the start of 2025, those chips cost $25 to $29. Today they are around $70. Apple’s supply deals with Samsung and SK Hynix will expire in January 2026, which may force the company to accept higher rates or raise iPhone prices.Samsung has already told customers to expect memory price hikes of 30% to 60% in late 2025. IDC forecasts that average PC prices could rise by up to 8% in 2026. Smartphone prices are also expected to reach a new high, averaging $465 per device.PC makers and phone brands are feeling the most pain. Memory is a large cost in each product, and buyers expect better specs every year. When companies cut memory, they risk losing sales. If they raise prices, they risk shrinking demand.Meanwhile, memory suppliers such as Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron Technology (MU) are benefiting. HBM demand from AI platforms such as those built by Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) has created a pricing floor that yields strong profits for chipmakers.
		However, if DRAM shortages persist through 2027, chip buyers may push back. PC and phone companies could redesign their products to use less memory. Governments could also step in to rebalance the chip supply, especially in markets like Korea and China, where memory is a national focus.We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to align all the stocks appearing in the piece.
