Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are long-time rivals in the global chip market. Intel is working through a turnaround after years of lost market share, while AMD continues to gain ground with stronger chip designs and steady execution. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we compare Intel and AMD to see which stock Wall Street analysts currently favor.Intel shares are up about 81% so far this year, reflecting growing confidence in the company’s turnaround efforts. Intel is working to regain ground in PCs and data centers by improving execution, launching new chips, and scaling its foundry business. Adding to the positive tone, a previously announced deal between Intel and Nvidia (NVDA) has now cleared U.S. antitrust review. The approval allows Intel to receive a large cash payment from Nvidia, giving the company more funds to support its ongoing plans.That said, Wall Street is still not fully convinced. Some analysts see signs of improvement in Intel’s chip roadmap and believe the stock could offer long-term value if the company delivers on its manufacturing plans. Others remain cautious, citing continued losses, heavy capital spending, and the risk of delays in new chip launches. For now, Intel’s outlook hinges on whether it can stabilize margins and show steady progress over the next few quarters.
		Reflecting the optimistic view, Bank of America recently upgraded Intel to Buy from Neutral. The firm pointed to improved stability, stronger liquidity, and more attractive relative value. It added that Intel’s lower exposure to the AI cycle could help limit downside if AI spending slows, even as competitive pressures remain.AMD has been one of the strongest performers in the chip space in the second half of 2025. The stock has gained 78% year-to-date, helped by solid data-center demand, higher spending from large cloud firms, and growing interest in AMD’s AI inference chips. However, concerns about a possible AI bubble have recently weighed on the stock.At the same time, Wall Street remains positive. Many analysts expect the next phase of growth to come from steadier AI demand in data centers, as inference chips take on a larger role. Looking ahead, several see 2026 as a key year when AMD’s AI revenue becomes more consistent, which could support further gains if execution stays on track.Backing that view, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar recently reiterated an Overweight rating on AMD and kept his $280 price target. Kumar said he remains confident in AMD’s near- and mid-term growth, pointing to the ramp of the MI300 chips and early progress on the MI400 series. He also noted that AMD continues to win new customers by offering strong performance at a lower overall cost across chips, networking, and software.Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we compared Intel and AMD to see which chip stock analysts currently favor. AMD holds a Strong Buy consensus rating, while Intel carries a Hold rating.
		Analysts see much more upside in AMD at current levels. AMD’s average price target of $279.94 implies about 30% upside, compared with Intel’s average price target of $38.09, which points to roughly 5% upside from current levels.AMD is the clearer analyst favorite, backed by a Strong Buy rating and higher upside on price targets. Intel’s rally has improved sentiment, but Wall Street remains cautious, with limited upside tied to execution risks. For now, analysts lean toward AMD as the steadier pick.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
