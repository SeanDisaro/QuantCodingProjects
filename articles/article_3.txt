Investors looking for stocks with long-term growth potential can consider mega-cap stocks, which have a market capitalization of more than $200 billion. These stocks are associated with large, well-established companies with strong track records and generally rank among the leading players in their respective industries. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, we placed Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) against each other to determine the mega-cap stock with the highest upside potential, according to Wall Street.Microsoft is benefiting from the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The company’s Azure cloud business is witnessing solid growth. In fact, Azure revenue surged 34% year-over-year to more than $75 billion in Fiscal 2025. Furthermore, revenue from Azure and other cloud services jumped 40% in Q1 FY26.Moreover, the company is also gaining from its relationship with ChatGPT maker OpenAI (PC:OPAIQ). Also, the integration of AI across MSFT’s productivity tools and other offerings is further boosting its business.
		However, investors are concerned about Microsoft’s elevated spending to build the infrastructure needed to support AI demand.Earlier this month, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow reiterated a Buy rating on MSFT stock with a price target of $625. The company announced price hikes for its Office and M365 subscriptions for Commercial customers, effective July 1, 2026. Lenschow noted that this marked the second price hike after the first increase in 2022, following the launch of Office 365 subscriptions in 2011.The 5-star analyst stated that the higher prices reflect Microsoft’s AI-driven pricing leverage, backed by stable enterprise demand. He noted that the company highlighted that the higher prices are supported by the addition of 1,100 new features across Microsoft 365, Security, Copilot, and SharePoint over the past year. Specifically, the M365 F1 subscription’s price was raised the most (by 33%), given this offering’s high net seat expansions.With 32 Buys and two Holds, Microsoft stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average MSFT stock price target of $632.32 indicates 32.1% upside potential. MSFT stock has risen about 14% year-to-date.See more MSFT analyst ratings.

Moreover, a U.S. federal judge’s ruling that the tech giant is not required to sell its popular Chrome web browser removed a major overhang.Last week, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth increased his price target for Alphabet stock to $385 from $340 and reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst thinks that 2026 could be a crucial turning point for the internet mega-caps as they progress from significant generative AI spending to delivering tangible financial returns on AI investments.Anmuth expects spending to intensify, with his estimates indicating a 20% to 60% increase in the capex of Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms.

JPMorgan’s 2026 Top Picks are Alphabet, Amazon, DoorDash (DASH), and Spotify (SPOT).With 29 Buys and seven Holds, Alphabet scores a Strong Buy consensus rating.
