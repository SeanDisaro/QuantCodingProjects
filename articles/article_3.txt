Broadcom (AVGO) just suffered a brutal 18% collapse over three trading sessions, marking its deepest dive since the pandemic-driven panic of March 2020. The sell-off followed a mixed earnings report that left investors spooked by a “mystery” fifth customer and a backlog that seemingly ignored a massive, unconfirmed partnership with OpenAI (PC:OPAIQ). Despite the technical carnage, analysts at J.P. Morgan (JPM) are standing firm, officially naming Broadcom their #1 semiconductor pick for 2026 while reiterating a conviction that this “stomp” is a generational buying opportunity.The bullish thesis hinges on a “once-in-a-lifetime” shift toward custom AI accelerators, or XPUs, which are tailored for massive inference workloads. J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur projects that Broadcom’s AI revenue will skyrocket from roughly $20 billion this fiscal year to as much as $60 billion in 2026. While Nvidia continues to dominate the general-purpose GPU market, Broadcom has carved out a fortress in the $30 billion custom chip segment, co-designing specialized silicon for “hyperscalers” like Google, Meta, and now potentially OpenAI.The primary source of investor concerns is a perceived lack of transparency regarding a rumored 10-gigawatt deal with OpenAI, which some analysts believe could be worth $300 billion in lifetime revenue. While management kept the details quiet during the latest call, Sur argues the “resurgence” in custom chip design is only in its early innings. Broadcom currently holds the #1 market share in high-end networking and custom ASICs, with Marvell Technology (MRVL) trailing as the second largest player.
		As major tech firms look to lower their “intelligence per watt” costs, Broadcom’s ability to integrate networking, 3D chip stacking, and co-packaged optics into a single rack-level solution makes it a “no-brainer” for the next infrastructure cycle. J.P. Morgan estimates that for every gigawatt of AI capacity deployed, Broadcom could rake in up to $30 billion in high-margin revenue, effectively creating a recurring income stream that traditional chip cycles can’t touch.Broadcom stock (AVGO) holds a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from Wall Street analysts. This strong endorsement is based on the ratings of 29 analysts in the last three months, with 27 recommending a Buy, two recommending a Hold, and none recommending a Sell. The average 12-month price target for Broadcom is set at $438.32, which represents an 36.6% upside from the last closing price.See more AVGO analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
