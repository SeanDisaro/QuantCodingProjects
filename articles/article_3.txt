After a reporter asked President Trump if the government is going to invest more in Intel (INTC), Trump answered: “Well, I don’t know about Intel, but I’ll invest more in other things. As you know, Intel came to see me; they needed help. And I said I’ll help you, but I want 10% of your company to go to the United States of America.” Trump also added later, “As soon as we went in, Apple (AAPL) went in, Nvidia went in, a lot of smart people went in – they followed us. So, yeah, we’re doing that deal,” according to Tom’s Hardware, which questions “Did the President make a mistake, or is he alluding to something that the public does not know?”  Intel previously disclosed that on December 26, the company completed the issuance and sale of 214,776,632 shares of the company’s common stock to Nvidia (NVDA) for an aggregate purchase price in cash of $5.0B, representing a price per share of $23.28 per share.Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
