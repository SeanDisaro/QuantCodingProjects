AI cloud provider CoreWeave (CRWV) has partnered with AI company Runway to support its advanced video generation tools. As part of the agreement, Runway will use CoreWeave’s access to chipmaker Nvidia’s (NVDA) powerful GB300 NVL72 systems to train and run its large AI models. Runway will also rely on CoreWeave’s W&B Models to closely monitor how their systems perform during both training and deployment.Unsurprisingly, CoreWeave says that more businesses are building tools and products around AI, so they need cloud platforms that deliver high speed, security, and scalability. Furthermore, Co-founder Brian Venturo praised Runway as a leader in generative video, not just in the tech world but also in top Hollywood studios. He added that CoreWeave is proud to support Runway as it continues to expand across more industries.At the same time, Runway’s CTO, Anastasis Germanidis, explained that the firm’s technology is transforming industries from filmmaking to simulation training. However, in order to keep innovating, Runway needs cloud tools that are fast, reliable, and able to grow with its needs. As a result, he said that CoreWeave’s platform will help the firm move quickly from research to real-world use, thereby making this partnership a key part of its long-term strategy.
