Anthropic, the company behind the Claude chatbot, is planning to raise about $10 billion in new funding at a valuation of roughly $350 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. Notably, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and hedge fund Coatue Management are expected to lead the round, which would be the third major AI megadeal in the past year. The financing is expected to close in the coming weeks, though the final amount could still change.This raise follows a $13 billion investment completed in September that valued Anthropic at $183 billion. In addition, the company is set to receive up to $15 billion more from Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT), according to the report. As part of that arrangement, Anthropic has agreed to spend $30 billion on computing capacity through Microsoft Azure, using Nvidia-powered AI systems. The deal highlights just how capital-intensive the race to build advanced AI models has become.Founded in 2021 by siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, Anthropic has already raised tens of billions of dollars and is expected to go public this year. Existing investors include Lightspeed Venture Partners, Fidelity, and Iconiq Capital. Interestingly, the company reportedly expects to break even in 2028, earlier than rival OpenAI, which develops ChatGPT. OpenAI, meanwhile, is also seeking fresh funding and is reportedly in talks to raise as much as $100 billion at a valuation of $750 billion.
		Turning to Wall Street, out of the two stocks mentioned above, analysts think that Nvidia stock has more room to run than Microsoft. In fact, Nvidia’s price target of $263.76 per share implies 39.2% upside versus Microsoft’s 29.4%.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
