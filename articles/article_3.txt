Nvidia (NVDA) is scheduled to release its Q3 FY26 earnings results on Wednesday, November 19. Wall Street analysts expect the semiconductor giant to report earnings per share of $1.25 on revenues of $54.89 billion. Ahead of the results, top Wedbush and KeyBanc analysts reaffirmed their Buy ratings on Nvidia stock.KeyBanc analyst John Vinh reiterated his Overweight rating on Nvidia and kept his $250 price target ahead of earnings. The 5-star analyst expects the company to report strong numbers and offer upbeat guidance for the next quarter. Vinh said better production of Nvidia’s GB300 rack systems and rising shipments of the new Blackwell B300 chips should help lift revenue.He also pointed to higher shipments of Hopper GPUs, which he said could mean sales into China have resumed or that more units are being supplied to CoreWeave (CRWV). Vinh believes this could boost revenue in the second half of the year. With these trends in mind, he raised his revenue outlook for both the current quarter and fiscal 2026. He now expects Nvidia to report about $57 billion in Q3 revenue, which is above his earlier estimate and above the Street’s view.
		Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson also reaffirmed his Outperform rating on Nvidia and kept his $210 price target. The 5-star analyst said Nvidia may beat expectations again, as it has done in past quarters, helped by strong demand for AI chips. Bryson noted that spending from major cloud players like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta (META) is still rising, and he expects that trend to continue over the next year.Bryson also pointed to growing interest in Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell lineup. Early industry checks show strong orders from server makers and AI-focused customers, which he views as encouraging. He added that AI demand is now moving from early model training to real use cases, which could help Nvidia reach more markets and support the next stage of its growth.Ahead of Q3 earnings, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Nvidia stock based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell recommendation. The average NVDA stock price target of $242 indicates 27.3% upside potential. NVDA stock has risen 42% year-to-date.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
