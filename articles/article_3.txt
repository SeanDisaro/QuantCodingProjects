Large technology stocks may be set for a comeback in early 2026 after lagging the market in the fourth quarter, said Morgan Stanley (MS) senior portfolio manager Andrew Slimmon in comments to CNBC. Interestingly, tech now looks more attractively priced than industrial stocks, which have already risen as investors bet on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. As a result, Slimmon believes that most of the good news is already priced into industrial stocks.By contrast, the so-called Magnificent Seven — Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL) — are trading at lower valuation levels than they were at the start of last year. Importantly, Slimmon said that there are no signs of earnings weakness in these companies. In addition, using a Warren Buffett quote, he explained that stocks can act like a “popularity machine” in the short term, even when long-term earnings remain strong, which helps explain why tech stocks struggled in the fourth quarter.Slimmon also warned that investors may be taking on more risk in cyclical areas. Since, as already mentioned, many industrial stocks have already priced in rate cuts, their earnings will now have to deliver to justify current valuations. Therefore, this raises the risk of a multiple compression. However, financial stocks are an exception, as they still trade at about a 30% discount to the overall market despite solid performance. Finally, Slimmon downplayed worries about whether markets can absorb large amounts of AI-related funding through IPOs and debt by saying that he does not see this as a meaningful negative.
		Turning to Wall Street, out of the Magnificent Seven stocks mentioned above, analysts think that NVDA stock has the most room to run. In fact, NVDA’s average price target of $262.79 per share implies 38.7% upside potential.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
