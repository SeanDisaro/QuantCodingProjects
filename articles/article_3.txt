Two major AI firms, OpenAI (PC:OPAIQ) and Xai (PC:XAIIQ) , are changing how they pay new hires. According to a Wall Street Journal report, both companies recently removed or relaxed a standard policy known as a “vesting cliff.” This change comes as competition for AI engineers continues to drive up pay and reshape job offers.Most tech companies have a 12-month vesting cliff. That means new employees must stay at the company for at least one year before they can receive any stock-based pay. But now, OpenAI has ended its vesting cliff altogether. Elon Musk’s xAI also shortened its vesting schedule earlier this year, according to people familiar with the matter.These changes are meant to make job offers more appealing to top talent. If workers do not have to wait as long to receive stock pay, they may be more willing to take a job or accept the risk of switching teams.
		AI engineers and researchers are asking for higher pay, and many want to keep their options open. Large companies such as Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet $(GOOGL), and Anthropic (PC:ANTPQ) are offering stock and cash deals worth up to $100 million. That makes it hard for smaller or newer companies to compete without matching some terms.OpenAI already spends a large share of its revenue on stock-based pay. According to documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal, the company plans to spend $6 billion on such costs this year. That is about half of its expected revenue. Some investors have raised concerns that too much stock-based pay could reduce long-term returns.xAI also had to update its approach. After a wave of staff changes and some public image issues, the company saw its hiring pace slow earlier in the year. Some job candidates declined to interview, according to people involved in hiring. After xAI shortened its vesting period, the acceptance rate increased.OpenAI and xAI are not alone in rethinking stock rules. Other startups in competitive fields have also moved away from the one-year requirement. In many cases, new hires now receive part of their equity within months of joining.These changes suggest that talent costs may keep rising as the AI field expands. Companies are offering more flexible packages and higher pay to bring in top workers. While this can help with growth and speed, it also adds to operating costs and puts pressure on profit margins.
