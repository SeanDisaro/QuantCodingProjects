Catch up on the top artificial intelligence news and commentary by Wall Street analysts on publicly traded companies in the space with this daily recap compiled by The Fly:STATSIG ACQUISITION: In a post to its corporate blog, Microsoft partner OpenAI stated, “As we scale ChatGPT and build new applications to serve hundreds of millions of people and businesses around the world, our ambition is to push the frontier of AI research and turn it into intuitive, safe, and useful tools that people love. That takes strong engineering systems, fast iteration, and a long-term focus on quality and reliability. Vijaye Raji will step into a new role as CTO of Applications, reporting to Fidji Simo, following the acquisition of Statsig. As a hands-on builder and trusted leader, Vijaye will head product engineering for ChatGPT and Codex, with responsibilities that span core systems and product lines including infrastructure and Integrity. His experience as founder and CEO of Statsig, and a decade leading large-scale consumer engineering at Meta, brings both entrepreneurial vision and operating expertise to scale our next generation of products.” PARTNERSHIPS: Meta (META) is considering entering partnerships with Google (GOOGL) or Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI to enhance the AI features in its applications, Reuters reports, citing people familiar with the conversations. 
		NEW DATA CENTER: OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT that is backed by investors including Microsoft (MSFT) and SoftBank (SFTBY), is looking to build a new data center in India, currently scouting local partners to set up the facility with at least 1-gigawatt capacity, Mackenzie Hawkins and Sankalp Phartiyal of Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the matter. The location and timeline of the potential project remain unclear. This new data center could be a step forward in Asia for its Stargate-branded AI infrastructure push. SOLD OUT CHIPS: Nvidia (NVDA) said via X, “We’ve seen erroneous chatter in the media claiming that NVIDIA is supply constrained and ‘sold out’ of H100/H200. As we noted at earnings, our cloud partners can rent every H100/H200 they have online – but that doesn’t mean we’re unable to fulfill new orders. We have more than enough H100/H200 to satisfy every order without delay. The rumor that H20 reduced our supply of either H100/H200 or Blackwell is also categorically false – selling H20 has no impact on our ability to supply other NVIDIA products.” CHIP OPTIONS: Abu Dhabi’s G42 is talking to AWS (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and xAI to become tenants at its UAE-US AI Campus, and aims to diversify chip suppliers beyond Nvidia (NVDA), Semafor’s Kelsey Warner reports. Google and Microsoft, a G42 shareholder, are the furthest along in negotiations to offtake computing capacity, a person with direct knowledge of the talks says. G42 is also looking to AMD (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Cerebras Systems (CBRS) to supply some of the computing capacity at the campus, the person says.
