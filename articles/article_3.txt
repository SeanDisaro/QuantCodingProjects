Oracle’s (ORCL) shares dropped about 4% early Monday following a research note from TD Cowen that the software giant may axe up to 30,000 roles and sell its health tech unit Oracle Health. This comes even as the company disclosed plans to raise between $45 and $50 billion this year from debt and equity financing to fund its push into AI data centers.The massive job cut could help the company free up between $8 billion and $10 billion, according to CIO, which cited the research note. The number of roles to be cut amounts to about 10% of its workforce.Meanwhile, the company, which has been working to transform its business from a database powerhouse into a top AI cloud infrastructure provider, said it plans to use the funds to expand its capacity to serve its customers. Some of its clients include Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).
		Oracle expects to raise about half of the funds through bond sales early next year. However, the rollout of the fundraising plan comes at a time when some investors are fighting the company in court over losses from its recent $18 billion bond sales.Meanwhile, Oracle’s aggressive capital raise has emerged as a key source of concern for investors and analysts alike. Over the last five years, the Texas-based software giant has significantly expanded its debt profile from about $71 billion to roughly $105 billion. Last week, Morgan Stanley’s Keith Weiss reiterated his Hold rating on ORCL, warning that Oracle’s AI ambitions will drive up funding needs and weigh on earnings per share targets. In contrast, Guggenheim analyst John Difucci urged investors to stay patient, arguing that Oracle is ultimately positioned to generate explosive EPS growth.On Wall Street, Oracle’s shares currently enjoy a Strong Buy consensus analyst rating. This is based on 24 Buys and eight Holds issued by 32 analysts over the past three months.Moreover, the average ORCL price target of $302.41 implies about 84% growth potential.
