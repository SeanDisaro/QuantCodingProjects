Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has released CUDA 13.1 and CUDA Tile, which it describes as the most important update to its CUDA platform in nearly 20 years. CUDA is a tool that helps developers speed up their software by using GPU power. The new version includes a virtual instruction set focused on tile-based parallel programming. This allows developers to write code more easily without worrying about the low-level details of specialized hardware, such as tensor cores, according to the firm.With CUDA Tile, developers get more control over how their programs run, especially when using multiple types of GPUs. Instead of writing code for each tiny piece of data, they can now work with larger “tiles” of data and simply describe what needs to be done to each tile. The system’s compiler and runtime will then automatically figure out how to run the algorithm efficiently at the lower level, thereby making the process both powerful and user-friendly.For now, CUDA Tile is available in Python, which is a language that is widely used in AI development. However, Nvidia plans to add support for C++ in the future. In addition, Stephen Jones, Nvidia’s CUDA architect, noted that the CUDA Tile language will be released as an open-source project, allowing the developer community to contribute and expand its use.
