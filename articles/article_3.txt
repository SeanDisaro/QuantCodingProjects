A recent article from tech magazine Wired suggests that 2026 could favor Alibaba (BABA) rather than OpenAI (PC:OPAIQ) in the AI market. The argument is not based on hype or benchmark scores. Instead, the focus is on which models are being used in real products.According to the publication, Alibaba’s Qwen AI model is seeing faster adoption than many U.S. competitors. At the same time, several high-profile American releases have struggled to meet expectations. To illustrate this shift, the article highlights how Qwen is already embedded in working consumer and enterprise tools.In the meantime, BABA shares rose 1.45% on Friday, closing at $152.24. 
		During 2025, major U.S. AI launches lost momentum. OpenAI released GPT-5 in August 2025, but users soon reported basic mistakes and uneven responses. Several researchers noted that the model did not appear to be a clear upgrade over earlier versions.Meta Platforms (META) launched Llama 4 earlier in the year. However, the release failed to gain strong developer interest. In contrast to past versions, Llama 4 did not create a meaningful market impact.Because of these outcomes, Wired suggests that U.S. firms may be placing too much emphasis on benchmark gains. While these tests matter, they do not always reflect business needs. As a result, companies continue to seek AI that is reliable, adaptable, and affordable at scale.At the same time, Qwen’s use across global firms has expanded. Recent data shows that Chinese models surpassed U.S. models in downloads in July 2025. Qwen now represents more than 50% of recent downloads, with total downloads exceeding 600 million.Moreover, several major companies now rely on Qwen. Airbnb (ABNB) has said it depends heavily on the model, citing speed and low cost. The company also noted that other tools were not fully ready for its needs.
		Additional users include Nvidia (NVDA), Perplexity AI, and BYD (BYDDF), which has integrated Qwen into its vehicle dashboards, allowing drivers to interact with AI features during use. Reports also indicate that Meta is using Qwen alongside other models to help train an internal system, which signals broad industry acceptance.One key reason behind Qwen’s growth is its open model design. Developers can download and customize the system, which reduces costs and shortens development cycles. This approach contrasts with more closed U.S. offerings.In addition, the Qwen research team received the Best Paper Award at the NeurIPS 2025 conference. The recognition cited strong engineering work and access to large-scale computing resources. Other Chinese firms are following a similar path. DeepSeek released a model in late 2025 that delivers performance comparable to GPT-5 while reducing inference costs by more than 50%.Taken together, these trends highlight a broader shift in AI competition. Rather than focusing solely on model performance, companies prioritize deployment, cost control, and flexibility.Turning to the Street, Alibaba holds a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average BABA stock price target is $205.08, implying a 34.71% upside from the current price.
