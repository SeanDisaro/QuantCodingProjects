Shares of semiconductor firm Micron (MU) rallied on Tuesday after HSBC (HSBC) initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a $330 price target. HSBC analyst Ricky Seo pointed out that while Micron’s stock has already surged significantly this year, its momentum has slowed down recently due to investor worries. More precisely, some are concerned about financial risks tied to newer cloud companies and the Stargate Project, but Seo believes these fears are overblown.According to Seo, Micron is entering an upcycle that could last four to five years, compared to previous upcycles that typically lasted only two to three years. Therefore, he expects big investments from both established and newer cloud service providers, who are spending their own earnings to fund AI infrastructure. In addition, because memory supply isn’t growing quickly, this strong demand could lead to higher prices and profits. That’s why Seo thinks now is a good time to buy the stock.The analyst also highlighted the growing demand for more powerful servers and memory, especially as AI becomes more common. He specifically mentioned that Nvidia’s (NVDA) Rubin Ultra chip may need 3.5 times more DRAM than usual. Solid-state drives are also in high demand since they help AI servers run smoothly. Consequently, Seo expects the DRAM and NAND memory markets to grow by 69% and 62%, respectively, in 2026, which could make Micron one of the top companies to benefit from this AI-driven boom.
		Overall, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on MU stock based on 26 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average MU price target of $233.32 per share implies 7.5% downside risk.See more MU analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
