Tom Sosnoff, a well-known entrepreneur and the founder of Thinkorswim and Tastytrade, says that the hottest AI stock on Wall Street, Nvidia (NVDA), has now become “boring.” In an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid, he explained that Nvidia’s story is so widely known that it may already be fully reflected in the stock price. Even though Nvidia is clearly a leader in AI technology, Sosnoff believes that the market is now pricing the company as if everything will go perfectly. In his view, that leaves little room for positive surprises.Interestingly, though, Sosnoff made it clear that he likes Nvidia’s technology, and even compared its AI tools to having a “genius best friend” who is always available. However, he worries that too many investors are already betting on the stock, which increases the risk if sentiment changes. He said that the real issue is not Nvidia’s business, but how expensive the stock has become. With markets at record highs and volatility near multi-year lows, he believes that stocks like Nvidia are especially vulnerable if things start to shift.Moreover, Sosnoff expects a 10% to 15% market pullback between March and May, though he is not calling for a full crash. He noted that while stocks are rallying, the bond market has been unusually quiet, which could be a warning sign. He also questioned whether Nvidia will remain the world’s most valuable company by pointing out that Alphabet (GOOGL) has recently passed Apple (AAPL) and is closing in on Nvidia’s market value.
