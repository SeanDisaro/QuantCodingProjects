Shares in Foxconn (HNHPF), the major maker of Nvidia’s (NVDA) most advanced AI servers and related infrastructure, rose modestly on Monday on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The gains followed its record fourth-quarter sales, fueled by sustained demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure.Foxconn, which gave a sales update on its fourth-quarter earnings ahead of a full update expected in mid-March, said its sales during the period jumped 26.4% on a U.S. dollar basis to approximately $83 billion. The record performance was driven by revenue from the Taiwanese firm’s cloud and networking products division.Similarly, Foxconn said its sales also rose significantly from the prior quarter, hitting a record for December sales. However, the firm blamed weaker exchange rates for the slight fall in revenue from its consumer electronics business — Foxconn is a key manufacturer for Apple’s (AAPL) iPhones.
		The record sales for Nvidia’s critical manufacturing partner come as Wall Street remains bullish on the American AI chip heavyweight’s market strength in 2026, due to several factors, including the recent $20 billion Groq acquisition, expected participation in the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show 2026 event, and H200 chip exports to China. For Apple, this coincides with expectations that the American consumer electronics giant shipped more smartphones globally in 2025, overtaking, for the first time in 14 years, South Korean rival Samsung (SSNLF).Nvidia and Apple also rely on the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), the world’s biggest AI chip foundry, for critical technology supply and have reportedly secured or are looking to lock down access to advanced AI chip nodes from the Taiwanese firm. Meanwhile, Foxconn expects to deliver the $1.4 billion supercomputing cluster it is building for Nvidia — in partnership with the Taiwanese government — during the first six months of this year.Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, investors can compare how artificial intelligence and related stocks compare, including those mentioned in this article.
