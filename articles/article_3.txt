Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been on a roller-coaster ride lately. After a powerful multi-year run, the shares have shown more uneven momentum heading into earnings season, with investors weighing strong AI demand against valuation concerns and policy overhangs. Recent trading sessions have featured choppy back-and-forth moves as investors react to shifting sentiment around AI infrastructure spending and megacap tech budgets.Wall Street still expects hefty year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings in the February 25 report, but the bar is set so high that even small cracks in the story could trigger volatility.One of the biggest near-term challenges remains Nvidia’s exposure to China and export controls. Regulatory hurdles and shipment restrictions have slowed advanced GPU sales into the region, creating uncertainty around how much China will contribute to forward guidance. At the same time, input costs are moving higher, especially in high-bandwidth memory, which is essential for AI accelerators. Add rising competition from in-house chips being developed by hyperscalers, and investors are watching margins and guidance more closely than ever.
		Amid this backdrop, top investor Deep Value Investing, who is among the top 3% of stock pros covered by TipRanks, argues that the longer-term bull case remains very much alive, and that pessimists are missing the bigger picture. “Over a long-term horizon, I think the AI bears are dead wrong on Nvidia Corporation. Fundamentals and, most importantly, the Street’s growth expectations are intact,” the investor opined.Deep Value Investing points to continued upward revisions in Street models and massive projected AI infrastructure budgets as evidence that demand has not rolled over.Still, the investor is not ignoring the near-term risks around the upcoming print. In fact, Deep Value recently turned more cautious into earnings. “I am downgrading NVDA heading into Q4 earnings,” the investor wrote, highlighting two specific pressure points: margins and forward guidance. “The key factor to monitor is whether Q1 FY27 guidance includes China GPU revenue. Excluding it could trigger a post-earnings selloff, as I think sales expectations may be priced in,” the investor warned.
		Margins are the second watch item. Deep Value warns that rising HBM prices and potential absorption of U.S. export fees could drag gross margin below the mid-70% range investors expect. Even with those concerns, his core stance stays constructive. Hyperscaler spending plans remain enormous, and next-generation platforms could extend the growth curve.“With no signs of a slowdown in hyperscaler CapEx spend this year ($600B estimate), and the Rubin upside later this year, my rating on NVDA stock is a Buy [downgraded from Strong Buy],” the investor summed up.Wall Street also remains bullish on Nvidia shares ahead of earnings. The stock carries a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 recent analyst ratings, including 37 Buys, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell. The average 12-month price target stands at $260.06, implying ~37% upside from the recent trading level near $190.
