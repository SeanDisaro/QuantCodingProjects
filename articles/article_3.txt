Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) is scheduled to announce its results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2026 on February 25. NVDA stock has risen 35% over the past year but is down nearly 2% so far in 2026 amid concerns about growing competition and fears about an AI (artificial intelligence) bubble. Nevertheless, top Wall Street analysts remain bullish on Nvidia due to its solid execution, robust demand for its AI GPUs (graphics processing units), and continued innovation.Moreover, the major hyperscalers: Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL), have committed high AI infrastructure spending, boding well for Nvidia.Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Nvidia to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.52, reflecting 71% year-over-year growth. Revenue is projected to rise 67% to $65.58 billion.
		Earlier this month, Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia, saying that the stock’s valuation has become attractive again following the recent pullback, with the chip giant’s long-term earnings trajectory staying intact. The 5-star analyst noted the continued strength in Nvidia’s fundamentals. Citing the company’s broader AI outlook, Caso sees a “clear path” to upside in calendar year 2026 and 2027 estimates, driven by pricing tailwinds as Rubin and Rubin Ultra ramp and continued unit growth. Given these drivers, Caso raised his Fiscal 2028 (calendar year 2027) EPS estimate to nearly $11.50, $1.50 above consensus.Also, according to CNBC, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh reaffirmed a Buy rating on Nvidia stock last week, saying he believes the company remains uniquely positioned to benefit from AI/ML (machine learning) secular data center growth. With major barriers to entry posed by Nvidia’s CUDA software stack, the 5-star analyst sees limited competitive risks and expects the company to continue to lead one of the fastest-growing workloads in cloud and enterprise.Additionally, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri increased his price target for Nvidia stock to $245 from $235 and reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst thinks sentiment heading into Q4 earnings appears positive, especially with Nvidia’s GTC event scheduled for next month. Arcuri expects Q4 FY26 revenue to come in at about $67.5 billion, about $2.5 billion ahead of guidance. Using Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD) recently reported results as a reference, Arcuri sees the possibility of “another few $B revenue into China that could sit on top for FQ4 results.” Excluding the China business, the analyst expects Nvidia to issue a revenue outlook of $76 billion for Q1 FY27, above investors’ expectations in the range of $74 billion to $75 billion. While Arcuri remains confident about Nvidia’s 75% gross margin outlook for the near term, he noted investors’ skepticism about the company’s ability to sustain these levels amid potential competitive threats from Alphabet-owned Google and Broadcom’s (AVGO) tensor processing unit (TPU) chips.With 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell recommendation, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Nvidia stock. The average NVDA stock price target of $260.38 indicates 42.4% upside potential.
