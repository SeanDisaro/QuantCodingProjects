Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers believes Microsoft’s (MSFT) launch this morning of its second generation Maia 200 AI chips to power OpenAI’s GPT 5.2 and Microsoft Copilot will be viewed as lessening the company’s reliance on Nvidia (NVDA). Wells views as a “derivative positive” for both Marvell (MRVL) and Arista Networks (ANET). Marvell is thought to be the key partner for Microsoft’s Maia 200 silicon, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The firm also believes Microsoft’s emphasis on Ethernet-based scale-up support to 6,114 accelerators in a second-tier domain could be viewed as potentially positive for Arista.
