In the opening hour of the evening session, U.S. equity futures are up marginally, with S&P 500 e-minis and Nasdaq 100 contracts rising by less than a decimal.  In commodities, WTI Crude Oil is holding the gains to $61 per barrel, while precious metals are little changed, with Gold just shy of $4,150 and Silver up for the sixth straight day above $51 per ounce.Tuesday’s trading was a mixed bag and hardly a continuation of Tech-sector driven Monday’s bounce.  S&P 500 eked out a gain, but Nasdaq Composite was lower and paced by the 3% sell0ff in shares of Nvidia (NVDA) after SoftBank disclosed overnight that it exited its entire $5.8B position in October.  The news weighed on the Semiconductors, Semi Equipment, and Hardware names especially, with Tech also seen as the worst performing sector on the S&P 500.  Conversely – the more defensive areas of the market were strong.  Health Care was the top segment in the broader index, as Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) broke out with above-2% gains to its highest level of this year.Check out this evening’s top movers from around Wall Street, compiled by The Fly.
