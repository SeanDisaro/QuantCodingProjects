Nvidia (NVDA) announced an investment of GBP2B in the U.K. market to catalyze the nation’s AI startup ecosystem and scale the next generation of globally transformative AI businesses. The new capital will be used to foster economic growth, develop more innovative AI technologies, create new companies and jobs, and empower the U.K. to compete in the AI market globally. Scaling AI companies in the U.K. has been challenging due to limited access to supercomputing, constrained venture capital outside London, rising energy costs and difficulty for VCs to access leading academic institutions, where many researchers are also entrepreneurs, the company said. Nvidia, in collaboration with Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton Capital, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court, will accelerate the U.K. AI ecosystem by providing new capital for AI startups. The investment will expand access to capital in key U.K. economic centers, AI growth zones and deep technology ecosystems like London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester. Nvidia’s investment, combined with new, world-class AI infrastructure, will empower researchers and developers nationwide, fueling the launch and growth of AI startups. Following Nvidia’s recent commitment to manufacturing up to a half-trillion dollars’ worth of AI supercomputers in America, the investment will be domiciled in the United States and activated in the United Kingdom, celebrating the transatlantic partnership between the two countries. .Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
