Nvidia-backed (NVDA) startup Starcloud has become the first company to train an advanced artificial intelligence model in space, according to CNBC. The Washington-based firm launched a satellite equipped with an Nvidia H100 chip, which is about 100 times more powerful than any GPU previously sent to orbit. That satellite, called Starcloud‑1, is now running Google’s (GOOGL) Gemma language model, thereby making this the first time a large AI model has operated on a high-powered Nvidia GPU outside Earth. Starcloud’s goal is to prove that space can host large-scale data centers. The company argues that traditional data centers are putting pressure on Earth’s resources. In contrast, orbital centers could cut energy costs by up to ten times and power AI systems without relying on Earth’s power grid. Therefore, the company plans to eventually build a massive 5‑gigawatt data center in space that would produce more power than the biggest power plant in the U.S. by using solar energy that’s available constantly in orbit.Additionally, the company says that these space-based centers could support commercial and military tasks, such as detecting wildfires in real time or identifying lifeboats after shipwrecks. Interestingly, Starcloud is already testing this by running AI on satellite images from Capella Space. Its next launch in 2026 will carry multiple Nvidia H100 chips and new Nvidia Blackwell hardware, along with cloud software from startup Crusoe, so customers can run AI directly from space. Despite challenges like radiation, orbital debris, and data regulations, major companies like Google are pursuing similar projects.
