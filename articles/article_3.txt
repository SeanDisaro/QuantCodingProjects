Shares in Bitcoin miner and data center operator Iren Limited (IREN) closed Friday’s session 11.43% stronger. The rally came as AI chip stocks cheered the blockbuster fourth-quarter results posted by TSMC (TSM), the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer.During the quarter, TSMC grew its revenue by 26% to $33.73 billion. And more importantly, the chip foundry stated plans to spend between $52 billion and $56 billion in 2026, especially on advanced technologies. Sydney-based Iren, alongside rivals such as CoreWeave (CRWV) in the U.S. and Nebius (NBIS) in the Netherlands, generates and provides scarce AI cloud computing capacity to hyperscalers such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META).  
		They are, therefore, traded as a proxy for the AI boom. For instance, shares in these AI-focused “neocloud” companies surged in November after AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA) smashed Wall Street estimates for its third-quarter results. Despite suffering a rut in the final weeks of 2025 following its Q1 2026 earnings results, Iren shares surged over 300% in the year, fueled by continued hype for AI infrastructure companies. Since the start of this year, the stock has rallied a further 53%.H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese has contended that Iren is “set for a transformative year.” Colonnese pointed to continued heavy spending on AI infrastructure by hyperscalers.The five-star analyst argued that Iren’s recent $9.7 billion five-year deal with Microsoft is yet to reflect in its share price. He believes the Australian company could generate $1.94 billion in annual recurring revenue once the deal is fully ramped this year.On the contrary, the team at banking titan Goldman Sachs (GS) recently slapped a Hold rating on Iren. The team believes that Iren is seeing “hypergrowth” but argued that the growth pipeline for the neocloud company beyond the Microsoft deal raises some doubt.
		Across Wall Street, Iren Limited’s shares remain a Moderate Buy based on the analyst consensus rating. This breaks down to nine Buys, two Holds, and one Sell issued by 12 analysts over the past three months.However, the average IREN price target of $82.80 suggests over 43% growth potential.See more IREN analyst ratings here.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
