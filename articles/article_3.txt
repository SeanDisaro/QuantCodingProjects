Catch up on the top artificial intelligence news and commentary by Wall Street analysts on publicly traded companies in the space with this daily recap compiled by The Fly. FUNDING ROUND: Nvidia (NVDA) is close to a deal to invest $20B in OpenAI as part of its latest funding round seeking to raise up to $100B, Bloomberg’s Shirin Ghaffary and Ed Ludlow report, citing people familiar with discussions. The contribution by Nvidia is close to being completed, though the deal is not final and terms may still change, the report states.AI CHIP STARTUP: Semiconductor startup Positron is set to receive $230M in Series B funding, bringing the company to a $1B valuation, TechCrunch’s Rebecca Bellan reports. The startup intends to use the capital to ramp up deployment of its high-speed memory chips, a critical component for chips used for AI workloads, the author says, citing sources familiar with the matter. The Series B investment round, which was co-led by Arena Private Wealth, Jump Trading, and Unless, with strategic investment from Qatar Investment Authority, comes as hyperscalers and AI companies seek to reduce their reliance on Nvidia’s chips, the author notes. 
		CUSTOMIZED MODEL ACCESS: As Amazon (AMZN) weighs an equity investment of “tens of billions of dollars” in OpenAI, the companies are also discussing a commercial agreement that would require OpenAI to develop customized models for powering Amazon’s own AI products, sources familiar with the matter told The Information‘s Anissa Gardizy, Catherine Perloff and Amir Efrati. Such an arrangement could require both companies to tweak OpenAI models so they respond to customers the way Amazon wants and Amazon could use customized versions of OpenAI’s models for AI products such as the Alexa voice assistant, the report said. NVIDIA DISMISSES FEARS: Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said fears that AI will replace software companies are misguided, arguing it is illogical to think AI would rebuild core tools from scratch rather than rely on existing software, Reuters’ Nilutpal Timsina and Shivani Tanna report. His comments at an artificial intelligence conference in San Francisco hosted by Cisco Systems (CSCO) came after a global selloff in software stocks sparked by concerns that recent AI advances could disrupt data and professional services industries. “There’s this notion that the tool in the software industry is in decline, and will be replaced by AI … It is the most illogical thing in the world, and time will prove itself,” Huang said. COPILOT CHATBOT: Microsoft’s (MSFT) Copilot chatbot faces user frustration due to confusing branding and interoperability issues, with a decreasing percentage of users favoring it in one survey, The Wall Street Journal’s Sebastian Herrera reports. The percentage of paid Copilot subscribers using it as a primary option decreased from 18.8% to 11.5% from July to January, while Google’s (GOOGL) Gemini increased, according to Recon Analytics. Microsoft is heavily investing in marketing Copilot, including $60M spend on television ads in 2025 and a Super Bowl ad. CHATGPT PUSH: OpenAI is shifting resources away from long-term research toward advancing ChatGPT and its core large language models, reflecting competitive pressure from rivals like Google and Anthropic, Financial Times’ Cristina Criddle reports. The strategic pivot has prompted the departure of several senior research staff and marks a significant change from OpenAI’s research-led origins, according to the report.
