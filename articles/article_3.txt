Catch up on the top artificial intelligence news and commentary by Wall Street analysts on publicly traded companies in the space with this daily recap compiled by The Fly. SIRI STUMBLE: Apple’s (AAPL) long-planned update of its Siri virtual assistant has run into some issues during recent testing, possibly delaying the release of several highly anticipated functions, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports. After planning to include the new features in iOS 26.4, which is slated for a March launch, the tech giant is now working to spread them out over future updates, which could possibly mean pushing some features until at least iOS 26.5, set for May, and iOS 27, which comes out in September, people familiar with the matter told Gurman. Shares of Apple are up 1.1% in afternoon trading. RAISING $20B: Anthropic is nearing the completion of a deal to raise more than $20B in a funding round co-led by investors including Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, D.E. Shaw & Co. and Dragoneer Investment Group, Bloomberg’s Ryan Gould, Natasha Mascarenhas, and Shirin Ghaffary report, adding that the deal is set to value Anthropic at about $350B, nearly doubling its prior value, and could be announced as early as this week. The funding round includes a range of investors, such as Coatue Management, Singapore’s GIC, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA), the report says. 
		ADS ON CHATGPT: Paul Smith, Anthropic’s chief commercial officer, took a swipe at OpenAI’s plans to test ads in ChatGPT, telling CNBC that the company is focused on “growing revenue” rather than “spending money,” and less interested in “flashy headlines.” He was speaking as Anthropic struck an AI partnership with Man Group. In the interview with CNBC, Smith also said the market selloff in software stocks, sparked by Anthropic’s Claude Cowork tool, was “a lot of hyperbole.” Meanwhile, Target (TGT) said it will be one of the first advertisers working with OpenAI as it launches ads in ChatGPT. Target also said that brands that advertise through its Roundel retail media business will be able to participate in the ads pilot. REORGANIZATION: Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said via X, formerly Twitter: “xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution. As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism. This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors. We are hiring aggressively. Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.” DATA CENTER: Meta (META) announced that it is breaking ground on a data center in Lebanon, Indiana. “This facility represents an investment of over $10B in data center infrastructure and the surrounding community, one of our largest infrastructure investments to date. Designed to deliver 1GW of capacity, this data center will have the flexibility to handle both AI workloads and our core products. This site will support more than 4,000 construction jobs and 300 operational positions, and we’ll support the Boone County community through workforce development, community grants, and environmental projects.” Meta added: “In line with our commitments to clean energy and sustainable growth, we’re matching 100% of our new data center’s energy use with clean energy, and the data center will achieve LEED Gold certification once operational. The data center will use a water-efficient closed-loop, liquid-cooled system that recirculates the same water and will use zero water for a majority of the year. We aim to be good water stewards wherever we operate, which is why we’re restoring 100% of the water we consume in Lebanon to local watersheds. We’re also partnering with Arable to provide irrigation technology to independent farmers in Indiana’s Upper Wabash River Basin. This project will restore 200 million gallons of water a year for ten years and reduce costs for farmers. In addition, we’re revitalizing a section of the Deer Creek stream, which will improve the ecological health of the wetland corridor by expanding vegetation in the area and creating a better habitat for pollinators.” PIVOTAL SHIFT TO AI: Deutsche Bank upgraded BorgWarner (BWA) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $82, up from $46. The firm says the company’s entrance into the AI data center market is a “pivotal shift.” BorgWarner is changing from a traditional Tier-1 powertrain supplier to a more diversified multi-industrial entity, which warrants a valuation re-rating, the firm tells investors in a research note. Deutsche also views the company’s Q4 report as strong.
