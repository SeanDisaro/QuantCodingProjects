In 2026, investors are keeping a close watch on tech and AI stocks, worried about whether the massive spending on AI will pay off. However, Wall Street analysts are excited about the AI boom, and some tech stocks are standing out. Using TipRanks’ database, we’ve shortlisted three Strong Buy tech stocks, Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), that analysts like most.All three stocks carry a Strong Buy rating from analysts. Nvidia offers the biggest upside, with expectations of over 40% gains in 2026, followed by Amazon at around 24%. Alphabet’s near-term upside appears more limited, as the stock has already surged recently.Let’s take a look at the details.
		Nvidia sits at the center of the global AI boom. As spending on AI data centers ramps up worldwide, demand for its chips keeps rising. Strong cash flows further strengthen its position, allowing Nvidia to fund new chip development, scale production, and handle market ups and downs with ease.Among Wall Street bulls, Evercore ISI’s five-star analyst Mark Lipacis sets the Street-high price target for NVDA at $352, implying about 90% upside. He sees Nvidia’s strong earnings and growth outlook as proof of its AI leadership and suggests the company’s revenue forecast for 2025–26 could be conservative given robust AI demand.Most recently, Jefferies’s top-rated analyst Blayne Curtis raised his price target on NVDA from $250 to $275. He noted that Nvidia “remains fairly cheap,” trading at the mid-teens of Jefferies’ bottom-up CY27 estimate, with further upside possible beyond that period.Overall, analysts expect over 40% upside from current levels at an average price target of $263.44, with 39 of 41 rating NVDA as a Buy.Amazon continues to dominate e-commerce globally while rapidly growing its high-margin cloud business, AWS. Strong revenue growth, expanding Prime membership, and leadership in logistics give it a durable competitive edge.
		On Wall Street, Wedbush’s Scott Devitt has the highest AMZN stock price target at $340, signaling over 40% upside for 2026. He is bullish on Amazon, citing a strong long-term growth story fueled by a robust cloud backlog, major new data center investments, steady retail momentum, and strength in advertising.Most recently, Raymond James’s five-star-rated analyst Josh Beck reiterated his Buy rating on AMZN but reduced his price target from $275 to $260. Beck highlighted that the Q4 outlook looks strong, supported by healthy holiday trends, solid ad performance, and manageable AWS expectations. However, he believes that AI will likely be the main driver of Amazon’s stock next year.Overall, analysts predict roughly 24% upside from current levels at an average price target of $294.69, with 46 of 47 rating AMZN as a Buy.Alphabet remains a dominant player in digital advertising, fueled by strong growth in search and YouTube revenue. GOOGL stock ended 2025 up 65% and recently hit another record high, surpassing the $4 trillion mark on AI-driven investor optimism following its new AI deal with Apple (AAPL).Turning to Wall Street, Canaccord Genuity’s five-star-rated analyst Maria Ripps raised her GOOGL price target to a Street-high $390 recently, signaling over 17% upside.
		Ripps stated that while near-term caution exists due to the stock’s recent rally, she remains highly confident in Alphabet’s long-term prospects. She highlighted that the Gemini chatbot is scaling rapidly—now accounting for over 18% of generative AI web traffic—and that the new Gemini 3 Flash model could be a game-changer, delivering frontier-level performance at an attractive cost.Overall, analysts predict a modest 3% upside from current levels at an average price target of $342.39, with 27 of 34 rating GOOGL as a Buy.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
