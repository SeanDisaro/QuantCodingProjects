Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai said quantum computing is close to a key shift and compared the space to where AI stood five years ago. In an interview on BBC Newsnight, he said that the next five years could bring a clear step forward for real-world use. He also noted that Alphabet runs one of the top quantum programs in the field.Alphabet’s latest step came at the end of 2024 with its Willow chip, which showed what the team calls verifiable quantum gain. The chip used a tool named Quantum Echoes to run select physics tasks at a speed that was far ahead of top supercomputers. As a result, the work drew notice for its use in areas like chemistry and drug trials.Even so, Pichai also said that full-scale quantum tools are still at least ten years away. He said many parts still need work, such as better chip strength and lower error levels. He added that the machines must also run at very cold levels, which brings more limits.
		Meanwhile, the quantum theme has drawn strong interest from traders. IonQ (IONQ) rose about 52% in the past year. D Wave Quantum (QBTS) rose about 720% in that same time. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) rose by about 740%. As a result, all three names saw sharp swings. Each one fell at least 35% from its recent high.Even with the sharp moves, analysts still see room for gains. Current targets point to a rise of about 54% for IonQ, 58% for Rigetti, and 71% for D-Wave. In addition, the quantum market is set to reach $20.20 billion by 2030, which is up from $3.52 billion in 2025.At the same time, larger tech firms are adding more work in the field. IBM (IBM) is building larger systems. Microsoft (MSFT) is adding more tools to its cloud site. Nvidia (NVDA) is building more ways to link chips and quantum systems. As a result, the space is now more active, and traders are watching for the next clear sign of progress.We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to align all the pure-play quantum stocks appearing in the piece, alongside big tech companies with quantum operations.
