Every member of the Magnificent 7, which makes up roughly one-third of the S&P 500 (SPX), has posted a negative return for 2026 as of Friday’s close. The disappointing performance comes amid fears of overspending in the AI industry, as well as the effects of the technology on future sales and margins. Microsoft (MSFT) has been hit the hardest with a loss of 17%, while chip leader Nvidia (NVDA) has been the least affected within the group with a loss of about 2%.Investors have broadened their focus beyond tech, targeting AI beneficiaries in the energy and healthcare sectors.
		“Focusing solely on the US information technology sector is unlikely to fully capture the direct beneficiaries of AI,” said UBS Global Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele.In addition, investors have also rotated capital into international stocks, with many continuing to outperform the S&P 500 following strong returns in 2025.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
