Market volatility tied to the Greenland tariff dispute could weigh on stocks in the near term, but Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said the pullback should be used to buy leading tech names such as Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Palantir (PLTR), Alphabet (GOOGL), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Nebius (NBIS), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA).Ives said markets are likely to open weaker as investors react to rising U.S.-Europe trade tensions, with President Donald Trump focusing on Greenland. The firm expects a short-term “risk-off” move, especially in AI-linked stocks.Ives said the current tariff “war of words” is weighing on sentiment and making investors more cautious, particularly toward technology stocks. However, he stressed that this type of trade noise has surfaced many times before and has not changed the market’s broader direction.
		Speaking from Davos, Ives noted that trade tensions are a key topic ahead of Trump’s meetings with global leaders and tech executives at the World Economic Forum. Still, Wedbush expects talks and negotiations to ease tensions over time.The firm’s view is that “the bark will be worse than the bite,” with negotiations likely to cool tensions over time, much as they have in past tariff disputes between the U.S. and Europe.Wedbush expects technology stocks to come under pressure first if markets turn cautious, but sees that weakness as a buying opportunity. The firm believes the AI cycle remains intact and expects a strong fourth-quarter earnings season, supported by roughly $550 billion in capital spending from Big Tech this year.Ives said the U.S. is now clearly ahead of China in the global tech race, driven by heavy AI investment and innovation across major platforms and chipmakers.He added that the Greenland tariff noise does not change the long-term outlook. Instead, Wedbush would use any pullback to add to core AI and tech leaders, as it sees the next phase of growth carrying into 2026.
