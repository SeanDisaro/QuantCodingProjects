Catch up on the top artificial intelligence news and commentary by Wall Street analysts on publicly traded companies in the space with this daily recap compiled by The Fly. CHIPMAKING DIVISION IPO: Alibaba (BABA) is laying the groundwork for a potential listing of its chipmaking division T-Head, seeking to capitalize on strong investor interest in the limited group of companies aiming to challenge Nvidia (NVDA) in the market for AI accelerators, Yuan Gao and Debby Wu of Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. As an initial step, the company plans to restructure the unit so that it is partially owned by employees. Following the restructuring, Alibaba reportedly intends to explore an initial public offering, though the timing has not been determined. REVENUE RUN RATE: Anthropic’s revenue run rate has more than doubled since last summer to hit over $9B at the end of 2025, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg’s Natasha Mascarenhas, Shirin Ghaffary and Dawn Lim. The artificial intelligence startup had a $4B revenue run rate in July of last year, the report noted. Anthropic is lining up checks of at least a billion dollars from Coatue Management, Singapore’s GIC and Iconiq Capital in its latest financing, the report added.
		RISING COSTS: Global demand for products such as smartphones, personal computers, and gaming consoles is anticipated to shrink this year as companies begin to raise the prices of their products to offset the surging cost of memory chips, Jaspreet Singh and Zaheer Kachwala of Reuters report. As tech firms such as OpenAI, Google (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) continue to rapidly build-out AI infrastructure, much of the world’s memory chip supply has been absorbed, leading to an increase in prices as manufacturers prioritize components for data centers over consumer devices. The world’s three largest memory chip producers, Samsung (SSNLF), SK Hynix (HXSCL), and Micron (MU), have recently said they are struggling to keep up with demand. MIDDLE EAST INVESTORS: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been meeting with top investors in the Middle East to line up funding for a new investment round that could total at least $50B, Bloomberg’s Dinesh Nair, Ryan Gould, Vinicy Chan, and Shirin Ghaffary report. The company is looking to raise $50B or more in the round at a valuation of about $750B-$830B, according to people familiar with the matter. AI-ENABLED WEARABLE PIN: Apple (AAPL) is working on an AI-enabled wearable device roughly the size of an AirTag that would include multiple cameras, a speaker, microphones and support for wireless charging, Wayne Ma and Qianer Liu of The Information reported, citing people familiar with the project. The device could be introduced as early as 2027, though the effort remains at an early stage and could still be scrapped. If brought to market, the product would reportedly strengthen Apple’s position in the emerging field of AI-powered hardware, where OpenAI is preparing its own devices and Meta Platforms (META) is already selling smart glasses that integrate its AI assistant.LICENSING DEAL: Google DeepMind has signed a licensing deal with Hume AI, which builds emotionally intelligent voice interfaces, Wired reports. As part of the deal, DeepMind will hire Hume AI CEO Alan Cowen and roughly seven of its top engineers, according to the report.AI SLOP: YouTube CEO Neal Mohan published his annual letter on Wednesday, saying YouTube aims to reduce “AI slop” and has strengthened parental controls, while teasing Shorts updates. Mohan said, “As an open platform, we allow for a broad range of free expression while ensuring YouTube remains a place where people feel good spending their time. Over the past 20 years, we’ve learned not to impose any preconceived notions on the creator ecosystem. Today, once-odd trends like ASMR and watching other people play video games are mainstream hits. But with this openness comes a responsibility to maintain the high-quality viewing experience that people want. To reduce the spread of low-quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.” 
		AI CHATBOT: Apple (AAPL) intends to revamp Siri later this year by transforming the digital assistant into the tech giant’s first AI chatbot, with the code-named Campos bot to be embedded deeply into the iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems and replace the current Siri interface, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports, citing people familiar with the plan. The company is considering running the chatbot, which will rely on Google’s Gemini model, directly on Google Cloud and TPU chips and is also mulling unveiling the bot in June for a September launch, the author notes. Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
