FED CHAIRMAN: President Trump stated in a post to Truth Social, “THE TRUMP RULE: The Financial News today was great – GDP up 4.2% as opposed to the predicted 2.5% (and this, despite the downward pressure of the recent Democrat Shutdown!) – But in the Modern Market, when you have good news, the Market stays even, or goes down, because Wall Street’s ‘heads’ are wired differently than they used to be… We are going to be encouraging the Good Market to get better, rather than make it impossible for it to do so. We are going to see numbers that are far more natural, and far better, than they have ever been before. We are going to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The United States should be rewarded for SUCCESS, not brought down by it. Anybody that disagrees with me will never be the Fed Chairman!” INCREASE IN HIRING: Treasury Secretary Bessent stated on his X account, “Real GDP growth excluding government is up 4.7% at an annualized rate over the last two quarters. This is the exact opposite of what happened under Biden, when government growth contributed to historic inflation and depressed living standards.
