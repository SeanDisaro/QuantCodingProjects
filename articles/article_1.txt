Sequoia Capital is planning a large new investment in Anthropic, the AI company behind the Claude chatbot, according to a Financial Times report. Anthropic is aiming to raise at least $25 billion in the funding round, which would value the company at about $350 billion. While talks are still ongoing, the report said the final amount could change before the round closes in the coming weeks.At that level, Anthropic would rank among the most valuable private companies in the world, highlighting how much investor focus has shifted toward leading AI platforms.Singapore sovereign fund GIC and Coatue Management are among the backers, each expected to invest about $1.5 billion in the round, according to people familiar with the matter. Earlier reports from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News said Anthropic was raising closer to $10 billion at the same valuation.
		Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees and has focused on building AI tools aimed at business customers. Its Claude chatbot is positioned as a more controlled option for enterprise use, which has helped attract major partners.Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) have previously said they plan to invest up to $15 billion combined in Anthropic. Those partnerships give the company access to cloud services and advanced chips, which are essential for training large AI models.For investors, the size and backing of this funding round highlight how capital is concentrating around a small group of AI leaders.We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to compare notable traded companies that employ chatbots similar to ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.
