All eyes are on semiconductor giant Nvidia’s (NVDA) results for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2026 on February 25. Investors await management’s commentary on the demand backdrop for artificial intelligence (AI) chips amid concerns about rising competition from Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Ahead of Q4 earnings, top RBC Capital analyst Srini Pajjuri reaffirmed a Buy rating on NVDA stock with a price target of $240, saying that he expects the company to report a “solid” quarter.Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Nvidia to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.52 for Q4 FY26, reflecting 71% year-over-year growth. Revenue is projected to rise 67% to $65.71 billion.Pajjuri expects Nvidia to deliver a “3-4% beat/raise.” The 5-star analyst expects management to emphasize and potentially raise the company’s prior $500 billion+ backlog estimate for 2025-26. He expects Nvidia to report Q4 FY26 revenue and EPS of $65 billion and $1.50, respectively. Furthermore, Pajjuri expects NVDA’s Q1 FY27 revenue guidance to be at least 3% above the Street’s consensus of $71.7 billion, given the robust backlog.
		Additionally, the analyst expects Nvidia to reiterate a mid-70% gross margin outlook for Fiscal 2027. While rising memory prices could weigh on margins, Pajjuri believes longer-term HBM (high bandwidth memory) contracts, Samsung’s (SSNLF) possible entry into the HBM4 supply chain, and Nvidia’s strong pricing power will help offset this headwind.Pajjuri also pointed out that while headline 2026 hyperscaler capital spending projections remain strong, year-over-year growth is decelerating (excluding memory). That said, the analyst believes that capex remains “healthy” enough to support upside to current consensus estimates for Nvidia. Pajjuri also highlighted that his checks in the supply-chain indicate solid growth projections for Rubin, which should fuel continued momentum into 2027.Looking ahead, Pajjuri views Blackwell-trained frontier model rollout and the GTC conference as potential catalysts. Highlighting the stock’s attractive valuation, the analyst noted that NVDA is trading at a double-digit discount to peers/Magnificent 7 stocks.Currently, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Nvidia stock based on 31 Buys and one Sell recommendation. The average NVDA stock price target of $265.44 indicates 40% upside potential.See more NVDA analyst ratings.
