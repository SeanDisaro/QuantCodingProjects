Nvidia (NVDA) has lagged some AI stocks in recent weeks, but Morgan Stanley says the core story is getting stronger. In a note today, top analyst Joe Moore reiterated an Overweight rating and kept his $250 price target, pointing to supply-chain checks that continue to improve.The five-star analyst said strong results are already priced in, which helps explain the recent slowdown in the stock price despite steady demand. He noted that as AI spending grows, investor focus has widened to more AI-linked stocks beyond Nvidia. Even so, Moore does not see this shift as a threat to Nvidia’s position. The analyst said concerns about losing market share are overdone, and he expects the company’s upcoming Vera Rubin platform to further strengthen Nvidia’s lead in AI computing.
		Moore also addressed worries around funding at large AI model developers, which some investors fear could delay chip orders. He said those concerns have added noise in the near term but do not change Nvidia’s overall demand outlook.It is worth noting that Moore ranks 218 out of more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. He has a success rate of 61%, with an average return per rating of 20.8% over a one-year timeframe.According to TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the last three months. At $264.09, the Nvidia average share price target implies almost 37.89% upside potential.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
