Salesforce’s (CRM) growth is driven by its expanding AI tools, strong cloud offerings, and smart acquisitions. Rising demand for its products is also expected to boost overall revenue. Thus, this might be the right time to consider CRM stock, especially through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that offer diversified exposure without the risk of holding the stock directly.Investors seeking exposure to CRM stock may consider the SoFi Agentic AI ETF (AGIQ) and the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV). Let’s take a deeper look at these two ETFs.The AGIQ ETF gives exposure to companies driving the next wave of autonomous artificial intelligence.
