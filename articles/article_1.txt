Yardeni Research says investors are rotating out of the Magnificent Seven stocks and into the broader S&P 500 Index (SPX), a shift the firm thinks could continue through 2026. This rotation is due to concerns that heavy AI spending is putting pressure on the cash flows of large tech companies, while AI adoption boosts productivity and profit margins across the rest of the market.Importantly, the research firm has shifted from an “overweight” view on big tech to an “underweight” stance, now favoring Financials, Industrials, and Healthcare instead. The firm believes these sectors can use AI to boost productivity without bearing the high upfront costs of building AI infrastructure.In a recent note, Yardeni stated that the traditional year-end “Santa Claus rally” may be harder to sustain this year. The firm even declared “Mission Accomplished” on its 7,000-year-end target for the S&P 500 after the index hit 6,901 on December 11, suggesting that may be the high for the year.
		Yardeni argues that the Magnificent Seven, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), may be entering a correction phase similar to the DeepSeek episode earlier this year.Before the AI boom, these companies generated strong cash flow thanks to relatively low labor and capital spending. However, the race to dominate AI is causing them to invest tens of billions in infrastructure, which is squeezing their margins and increasing competition among them.Meanwhile, the rest of the S&P 500, what Yardeni calls the “Impressive 493,” trades at far more attractive valuations. The Magnificent Seven currently commands a forward-price-to-sales ratio of 7.8, compared to just 2.5 for the broader index.The research firm noted that the Magnificent Seven’s market cap has doubled to $20 trillion over the past two years and now represents 31.7% of the entire S&P 500. This is an unusually high level of concentration that Yardeni believes is unsustainable.Now, let’s see how Wall Street analysts are rating these seven mega-cap tech stocks, and which stock they believe has the strongest upside.
