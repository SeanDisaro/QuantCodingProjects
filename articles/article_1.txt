Nvidia (NVDA) stock is trading higher in early Tuesday hours. The shares have climbed about 42% over the past year and remain one of the market’s biggest AI winners. Even so, some analysts think the rally may not be finished. The most optimistic forecast points to more than 85% upside, based on Evercore ISI five-star analyst Mark Lipacis’ Street-high $352 price target and Buy rating. Overall, Wall Street also remains positive on the shares, with the average analyst target implying roughly 37% upside over the next 12 months.Lipacis believes Nvidia remains at the center of the AI boom. He said companies building AI systems rely on Nvidia not only for chips but also for the software tools that run them. As AI models grow larger and handle more tasks, they require far more computing power, which keeps demand for Nvidia’s data-center products strong.He also expects Nvidia’s upcoming systems to extend its lead, as they bring computing and networking together in one setup and make it easier for customers to install and use. Lipacis added that strong spending by cloud companies should support growth for many years, not just a short period.
		Beyond data centers, he sees future demand coming from robotics and autonomous machines as these technologies move closer to real-world use. Newer AI systems that can reason and act on their own may require much more processing power, which could further increase demand for Nvidia’s hardware and software.Nvidia is set to report its Q4 FY26 earnings on February 25. Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to post Q4 EPS of $1.52, up 70% from the year-ago quarter. At the same time, revenues are expected to grow 66% year-over-year to $65.56 billion, according to data from the TipRanks Forecast page.During the earnings call, investors will mainly watch whether data-center growth stays strong, since AI chips drive most of Nvidia’s revenue. Markets will also look for updates on demand from major cloud customers, supply levels, and the rollout of its next-generation platforms.Any comments on AI spending trends and future guidance could matter just as much as the quarterly numbers for the stock’s near-term move.Overall, Nvidia scores Wall Street’s Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell. The average NVDA stock price target of $260.06 indicates about 36.84% upside potential from current levels.
