Honeywell International (HON) confirmed on Thursday that Quantinuum, its quantum computing joint venture, has raised $600 million in new equity funding. The raise values the firm at $10 billion before the fresh capital. The deal is one of the largest in the quantum field and places Quantinuum among the best-financed players in the market.The round brought in a mix of new and existing backers. Quanta Computer, QED Investors, and NVentures, the venture arm of Nvidia (NVDA), joined as new investors. At the same time, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Mitsui & Co., Amgen (AMGN), and Cambridge Quantum Holdings all increased their stakes. Honeywell and Cambridge Quantum remain the two largest shareholders. Honeywell is estimated to hold about 53% of the company, while Cambridge Quantum, controlled by founder Ilyas Khan, has about 36%.The presence of NVentures in this round marks a shift for Nvidia. Earlier this year, Chief Executive Jensen Huang played down near-term expectations for quantum. Yet by mid-year, he signaled that the sector is reaching a turning point. Now, Nvidia is not only building tools for hybrid quantum and classical computing, but it is also backing Quantinuum directly. The investment is notable because it is the first time Nvidia has taken a stake in a quantum computing firm.
		For Nvidia, the interest lines up with its CUDA Quantum software, which helps link quantum and AI workloads. The link suggests that future quantum systems will be used in tandem with classical supercomputers, an area where Nvidia’s chips already hold a dominant position. With the chip powerhouse now on the investor list, Quantinuum gains a strong ally in both computing power and market reach.Quantinuum’s technology approach is based on trapped-ion hardware, which is known for its high accuracy and long-term stability. However, this approach does face scalability challenges, an issue that Quantinuum aims to resolve; its next Helios system is supposed to be a step in this direction. Beyond the machines themselves, the company also builds software and tools for users. Its platforms include InQuanto for chemistry research and TKET for program design. This full-stack model means that Quantinuum is not only a hardware maker but also a developer of applications that help industries test quantum solutions in real cases.The fresh capital is expected to support the expansion of commercial systems, research work, and manufacturing. A near-term goal is the launch of the Helios system, the company’s next-generation quantum computer. The company says Helios will simplify programming and move closer to fault-tolerant quantum computing, which is a key step in scaling.Using TipRanks’ Comparison Tool, we’ve lined up the tickers mentioned in the piece, alongside other notable quantum computing stocks. This helps investors gain a broader view of each stock and the industry as a whole. Quantinuum is expanding worldwide with operations in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Qatar, and Singapore. In Qatar, it is part of a $1 billion plan to grow national quantum capacity. In Singapore, it is working with partners on computational biology. These global links add to its role as one of the few firms with a presence across three regions.
		Honeywell has said that the funding prepares Quantinuum for a possible initial public offering as soon as 2027. With Honeywell still in control and Nvidia now on board, Quantinuum’s place in the race for commercial quantum systems has become stronger.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
