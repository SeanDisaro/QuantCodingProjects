Recently, electric vehicle giant Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk explained why Tesla was about to drop $10 billion on components from Nvidia (NVDA). Moreover, Musk also explained why that price tag would have had to double, if not for one key point. The explanation was palatable enough to investors, who gave Tesla stock a modest bump in Thursday afternoon’s trading.Musk detailed that the $10 billion buy would have ballooned to $20 billion if it had not been for Nvidia’s AI4 chipset. With Tesla on track to making two million cars a year—and growing, no less—it would require a lot more hardware to build. And without the AI4 chipset, Tesla would have had to buy twice as much hardware just to train AI systems, like those used in the Full Self-Driving system.But Musk had harsher words waiting for the larger market. Nvidia was doing a fine job of offering “helpful tools” for automakers, but the automobile industry was doing nowhere near so much. And while there were concerns that Nvidia might ultimately eat Tesla’s lunch on a self-driving system, others proved unconcerned. One report noted, “There is no scenario in which a company building on top of this new development kit will even slightly dent Tesla’s Robotaxi market opportunity.”
		Then, unexpectedly, reports came out of Indiana that suggest driving a Tesla might get you unwanted attention from the police. A report emerged detailing how a police officer pulled over a Tesla Model Y Juniper driver, noting that the tail lights were not on. This puzzled the driver, as the car had 1,100 miles on it at the time in question, being, essentially, brand new. He then demonstrated the brake lights, revealing that both turn signals and the red bar were operational.The officer, meanwhile, seemed unconvinced, noting that “…where the brake lights are it should be illuminated there also.” The officer then demanded the driver get the car fixed. How, exactly, that was supposed to happen was unclear at best. Further reports suggest that this is not the first time an officer has mistaken a standard Tesla light bar for an illegal modification.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on TSLA stock based on 13 Buys, nine Holds, and seven Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below.
