Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz raised the firm’s price target on CoreWeave (CRWV) to $100 from $92 and keeps a Neutral rating on the shares after the company and Nvidia (NVDA) announced an expansion of their relationship with plans  to accelerate the build-out of 5GW of capacity and an incremental $2B equity investment.
