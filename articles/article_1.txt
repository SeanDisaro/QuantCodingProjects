Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are up 35% this year – no mean feat – but compared with the blistering rallies of recent years that made the semiconductor giant the world’s most valuable company, that performance looks relatively muted.But for those thinking the stock’s huge growth spurt is now in the past, Tigress Financial’s Ivan Feinseth would like a word, as the 5-star analyst believes the shares are poised to generate sizable returns again next year.Feinseth, who ranks among the top 4% on Wall Street, assigns NVDA shares a Strong Buy rating while raising his price target from $280 to $350, suggesting the stock will rally ~90% over the next 12 months.

		Simply put, Feinseth believes Nvidia stands as the “must-own core holding in the AI investment theme,” supported by its full-stack leadership across GPUs, networking, CUDA software, and vertical platforms. This positions the company to “capture explosive growth” from the multi-trillion-dollar AI data center buildout, alongside expanding adoption in areas such as autonomous driving, healthcare, industrial digital twins, and related applications, all while continuing to generate “hyper-growth,” premium margins, and strong returns on capital as a “productivity revolution” drives a meaningful expansion in global GDP.Nvidia’s GPUs, networking solutions, and full-stack software platforms have become the “de facto standard” for training and inference across cloud, enterprise, and sovereign AI data centers. Meanwhile, the company’s deeply embedded CUDA and AI software ecosystem leads to high switching costs and a “durable competitive advantage.”The long-term growth is supported by its fast-paced, advanced GPU roadmap – from Hopper to Blackwell, Rubin, Feynman, and beyond – which consistently “resets the bar” for AI performance and efficiency. Moreover, its ventures into robotics and autonomous driving expand Nvidia’s presence from cloud data centers into physical AI, growing its total addressable market and integrating its technology across both virtual and real-world applications.“These dynamics together underpin NVDA’s key investment attributes,” says Feinseth, “outsized multi-year growth potential, exceptional profitability and free cash flow generation from an asset-light model, and powerful optionality from emerging AI use cases that can further accelerate business performance as AI adoption deepens across the global economy.”Furthermore, the healthcare business is becoming a significant yet often overlooked growth driver. The company is developing a comprehensive healthcare and life sciences franchise leveraging its AI and accelerated computing platform, with especially promising prospects in drug discovery, genomics, medical imaging, and digital biology.
		Finally, Nvidia’s robust balance sheet and strong cash flow enable a balanced capital allocation strategy that supports “accelerating growth” and enhances shareholder value. As of October, the company held $59.44 billion in excess cash, or $2.44 per share, and should generate $250.28 billion in Economic Operating Cash Flow (EBITDAR) over the next twelve months. This financial strength allows the company to continue investing in R&D, product development, and strategic acquisitions – particularly in software – further expanding its product and services portfolio and advancing its AI-driven pursuits.So, that’s Feinseth’s view, but what does the rest of the Street make of Nvidia’s prospects? Based on an additional 39 Buys and 1 Hold and Sell, each, the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for 12-month returns of ~44%, considering the average price target stands at $260.
