Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is reportedly in advanced talks to buy Israel-based AI startup AI21 Labs for as much as $3 billion, according to Israel’s Calcalist. Neither company commented on the report, but the discussions have drawn attention, given Nvidia’s growing role in artificial intelligence. For reference, AI21 was valued at about $1.4 billion in a 2023 funding round that included Nvidia as well as Google (GOOGL). If a deal is reached, it would represent a significant jump from that earlier valuation.AI21 was founded in 2017 by Amnon Shashua, along with two co-founders, and has benefited from the AI investment boom. Shashua is also the founder and CEO of Mobileye (MBLY), which focuses on self-driving car technology. Interestingly, AI21 has reportedly been open to a sale for some time, and negotiations with Nvidia have picked up in recent weeks. Importantly, the report suggests that Nvidia is especially interested in AI21’s team of roughly 200 employees, as many of them have advanced academic backgrounds and deep expertise in AI development.Additionally, the potential acquisition fits with Nvidia’s expanding presence in Israel. More specifically, Nvidia is planning a major new research and development campus in Kiryat Tivon, near Haifa. The planned campus would include up to 160,000 square meters of offices, parks, and shared spaces, with construction expected to begin in 2027 and initial occupancy targeted for 2031.
