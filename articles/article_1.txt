As demand for AI grows, companies are starting to focus more on speeding up AI models. To do this, chipmakers SK Hynix and Nvidia (NVDA) are working together to develop a new kind of solid-state drive (SSD) called an “AI SSD.” According to Chosun Biz, the project, nicknamed “Storage Next,” plans to use NAND chips to build a high-performance storage solution that works alongside other parts of the AI system.Interestingly, SK Hynix plans to show a working version of this AI SSD by the end of next year that could reach up to 100 million IOPS (input/output operations per second), reports say. This is much higher than what regular enterprise SSDs offer today and is important because AI systems often need fast, continuous access to large amounts of data, which current memory options like DRAM and HBM can’t fully handle on their own.The new AI SSD would act as an extra memory layer designed to support the unique demands of AI tasks. While this technology could greatly improve performance and energy efficiency, it may also put more strain on the global supply of NAND chips. In fact, demand for storage is already rising due to increased use by cloud service providers and AI companies. Therefore, if the AI SSD becomes widely used, the NAND market could face shortages similar to what recently happened with DRAM, causing prices to rise.
		Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on NVDA stock based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average NVDA price target of $258.97 per share implies 46.6% upside potential.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
