Chip giant Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter earnings on February 3. Ahead of Q4 2025 earnings, top Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse reaffirmed a Buy rating on AMD stock with a price target of $350, saying that he expects the company to deliver a “modest” beat for Q4 2025 and raise the outlook for Q1 2026. Meanwhile, top RBC Capital analyst Srini Pajjuri reiterated a Hold rating with a price target of $230, saying that he is “looking for a beat/raise.” Let’s look at the views of these analysts ahead of AMD’s Q4 earnings.AMD stock has rallied 120% over the past year, driven by optimism about the chipmaker’s new AI GPUs (graphics processing units), continued strength in the CPU (central processing unit) market, and strategic deals, including a partnership with OpenAI to deploy 6 GW of GPUs. Meanwhile, Wall Street expects AMD to report a 21% year-over-year jump in Q4 2025 earnings per share (EPS) to $1.32. Revenue is projected to rise 26.2% to $9.67 billion.
		Muse stated that following rival Intel’s (INTC) earnings miss, he expects AMD to slightly exceed Q4 2025 expectations and raise the outlook for the March quarter, as the company is not experiencing the same wafer transition for Client/Server businesses that weighed on Intel’s guidance. In fact, Muse sees potential for AMD to benefit from this transition if it can secure sufficient capacity from TSMC (TSM).The 5-star analyst expects strength across Advanced Micro Devices’ Data Center segment (both CPU/GPU). Specifically, Muse expects demand for server CPUs to remain robust, fueled by agentic AI and host servers for accelerated compute. The analyst also expects continued growth in Data Center GPU as the launch of the MI400 series nears in the upcoming quarters. “While Client units may be lower due to supply constraints, focus turns to higher ASPs [average selling prices] across both Client/Server as the company prioritizes higher-end SKUs,” said Muse.Meanwhile, RBC’s Pajjuri stated that he expects AMD to deliver a beat-and-raise quarter, fueled by encouraging server demand and share gains. In artificial intelligence (AI), Pajjuri expects management to reaffirm previous timelines for MI455 and Helios ramp despite recent worries about wafer supply and rack-scale execution risks. Pajjuri added that AMD management seems confident about the initial deployment in the OpenAI deal, with this optimism reflected in his estimates.Despite these positives, Pajjuri is sidelined on AMD stock, as he thinks that additional near-term upside to AI revenues seems less likely due to supply constraints. Furthermore, the 5-star analyst noted that major customers – Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and OpenAI, all have in-house ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chip programs expected to ramp in 2026 and 2027. With AMD stock trading at a 45% premium valuation to semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA), Pajjuri sees “balanced risk/reward” at current levels. Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Advanced Micro Devices stock based on 25 Buys and eight Holds. The average AMD stock price target of $286.66 indicates 16.4% upside potential.
