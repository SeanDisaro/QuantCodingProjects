The White House has set research priorities for fiscal year 2027, and artificial intelligence and quantum science lead the list. The plan comes from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. It directs federal agencies to move more funding into what are called critical and emerging technologies.In practice, that means a strong push in two directions. First, agencies will keep supporting basic science. Second, they will add more investment in applied projects that can reach the market. For quantum science, the focus is on test facilities, shared infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing of devices. For AI, the plan calls for new computer designs, stronger safeguards against manipulation, and tools that make systems easier to explain and control.Because these technologies depend on chips, networks, and advanced manufacturing, the policy also connects research to the U.S. strength in semiconductors. That means companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), Intel (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA) stand to gain from federal backing. Each of them plays a role in building processors for AI training and for future quantum devices.
		The plan also signals support for networks that utilize 5G and 6G, as well as for faster data systems. That could benefit firms like Qualcomm (QCOM), which leads in wireless chips. Moreover, the policy encourages research on exascale computers and edge devices, which ties in with companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Dell Technologies (DELL).Also standing to benefit are quantum computing companies already working with the government or taking part in the DARPA initiative. This includes companies such as IonQ (IONQ) and D-Wave (QBTS), as well as private companies like PsiQuantum, which is backed by Nvidia, and Quantinuum, a subsidiary of Honeywell (HON).   Beyond technology alone, the memorandum ties research goals to national security, energy, health, and space. For example, agencies are told to prepare for post-quantum cryptography, bring new nuclear projects, and fund space exploration. At the same time, they are told to expand workforce training in science and guard against foreign access to federally funded research.The government also points to “Gold Standard Science” as the model for future projects. That means studies should be reproducible, free from conflicts, and open to peer review. The aim is to support growth and protect sensitive research while still allowing wide collaboration.As a result, investors can see a clear signal that Washington views AI and quantum as drivers of U.S. leadership in the years ahead. The plan is broad, and its effect will depend on how budgets match the stated goals, yet the focus on chips, networks, and applied tools highlights the role of publicly traded firms across the sector.
