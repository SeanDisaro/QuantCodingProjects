OpenAI just rolled out a new AI model that’s powered by Cerebras chips. Importantly, this is the first time that it has launched a model built with non-Nvidia (NVDA) chips. The model, called GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, is a lighter and faster version of its newest Codex software, which helps automate coding tasks. While it is less powerful than the full version, it is designed to respond more quickly. That means developers can edit sections of code, run tests, stop the model mid-task, or redirect it to a new assignment without waiting for long computations to finish.This move comes as OpenAI continues to increase the number of chip suppliers it works with. Last month, the company signed a deal that was reportedly worth more than $10 billion to use Cerebras hardware in order to deliver faster AI responses. Around the same time, OpenAI reached a major agreement with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD graphics processing units over several years. It also agreed to buy custom chips and networking components from Broadcom (AVGO). Nevertheless, OpenAI made it clear that Nvidia still plays a central role. In a statement, a company spokesperson described the Nvidia relationship as “foundational” and noted that its most advanced AI models are the result of years of close hardware and software collaboration. The company also said that it will continue to rely on Nvidia as the backbone of its training and inference systems, while deliberately expanding its supplier base to include Cerebras, AMD, and Broadcom. 
		Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on NVDA stock based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average NVDA price target of $260.38 per share implies 37.6% upside potential.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
