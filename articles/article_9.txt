AI giant Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report its Q3 FY26 earnings on Wednesday, November 19, after the market closes. The stock is up about 42% so far this year, helped by strong demand for its AI chips and data center hardware. Its new Blackwell GPUs continue to gain traction with hyperscalers and large enterprise customers building out AI systems. Though uncertainties around China remain, Wall Street remains broadly positive heading into the report. Analysts still see further upside, with the average price target suggesting about 28% potential gains from current levels.Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to report earnings of $1.25 per share for the third quarter of Fiscal 2026, up 54% from the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, analysts project Q3 revenues of $54.79 billion, according to the TipRanks Analyst Forecasts Page. This marks a year-over-year increase of over 56%.China will remain a watch point during the earnings call. Nvidia cannot sell its top Blackwell chips into the region under current export rules, and demand for the adjusted versions built for China has been softer than expected.
		The company is still working through orders, and investors will be watching for any update on how much revenue China can contribute going forward. In addition, they will closely watch for updated guidance on data center growth and supply outlook.Ahead of the print, Top Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer expects Nvidia to post stronger-than-expected Q3 results. He raised his price target to $265 from $225 and kept an Outperform rating, saying demand for Nvidia’s AI chips “remains extremely strong.” The 5-star analyst believes Nvidia is well-positioned to beat both Q3 and Q4 expectations as cloud customers continue to lift their spending on AI hardware.Similarly, top-rated analyst Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna also raised his price target to $230 from $210 and kept a Buy rating. He said demand in Nvidia’s data center business remains strong, led by heavy spending from major cloud players. Rolland added that Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra chips could have roughly 14% higher pricing, and the shift toward higher-priced products like the B300 and GB300 should support solid revenue growth in Q3 and Q4.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on NVDA stock based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average NVDA price target of $240.00 per share implies 28.44% upside potential.See more NVDA analyst ratings
