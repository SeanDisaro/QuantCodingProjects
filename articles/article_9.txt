Nvidia (NVDA) will release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2026 results after the market closes tomorrow, February 25. With AI GPU demand staying robust, investors will look for confirmation that revenue and margins can support current valuations. The chip giant’s results mark a pivotal moment for investors tracking its lead amid booming GPU demand and competitive pressures. With shares trading around $185–$190 recently, Wall Street anticipates robust results that could propel the stock higher or expose valuation risks.Nvidia dominates the AI infrastructure market with an estimated 80% GPU share through its H100/H200 AI chips and emerging Blackwell platforms. At the same time, Nvidia faces an ongoing battle over China market recovery, Rubin GPU timelines, and hyperscaler spending. Over the past year, NVDA shares have surged nearly 47%.According to Wall Street estimates, Nvidia is expected to post adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.54, up nearly 73% from the year-ago figure of $0.89. Moreover, sales are forecast to jump 68% year-over-year to $66.13 billion.
		For full-year fiscal 2026, sales are projected at $213.3 billion and adjusted earnings at $4.69 per share. Data center sales have been a major revenue driver for Nvidia through the first nine months of the fiscal year, totaling $131.4 billion.Heading into the results, a majority of analysts have reiterated their Buy ratings on NVDA stock, while Aletheia Capital analyst Stefan Chang upgraded the shares from Hold to Buy. Chang maintained his $250 price target, which suggests 30.5% upside potential. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri raised his price target from $235 to $245, implying 28.3% upside. He noted that the supply chain remains strong and the setup into the next earnings period is favorable, particularly with the GTC developer conference coming up in mid-March.Arcuri also believes Nvidia will exclude China sales from its guidance since market reopening is still uncertain amid rising domestic chip adoption. Profitability questions persist as peers build AI processors. UBS sees little near-term risk to Nvidia’s roughly 75% gross margin and expects management to address competitive concerns during the earnings call and GTC.Similarly, Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider maintained a $250 price target ahead of the results. He expects Nvidia’s Q4 sales to hit $67.3 billion, implying a $2 billion revenue surprise above the consensus, and a bottom-line beat.
		Schneider highlighted drivers that could push Nvidia’s stock higher after the results, including stronger-than-expected hyperscalers’ capex, positive comments on FY27 data-center sales forecast, a ramp in GPU demand from LLM companies, the competitive advantages of Nvidia’s CUDA platform, China demand trends, and progress on Rubin production.On TipRanks, Nvidia stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, zero Holds, and one Sell rating. The average Nvidia price target of $268.57 implies 40.2% upside potential from current levels.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
