U.S. tech bosses will need to start searching for a white tie and a book on royal British etiquette as they get ready to accompany President Trump on his state visit to the U.K. next week.According to a report on Sky News in the U.K., Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang is expected to be one of the tech bosses attending a state banquet at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles III during the trip.Despite celebrating its independence from the British Crown every July 4th, the high-profile trip to the heart of royal London is clearly a must for political and business leaders.
		According to Sky, other tech titans heading across the Atlantic include Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI; Larry Fink, chairman and chief executive of asset management firm BlackRock (BLK); and Stephen Schwarzman, the boss of private equity giant Blackstone (BX).Tim Cook, the Apple (AAPL) chief executive, has also been invited and may attend the state banquet, while Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan (JPM) boss, is understood to be unable to make the trip to Britain because of existing diary commitments.Of course, these leaders are unlikely to have joined the trip just to be wined and dined in a castle by the King. Their presence could signal a wave of potential tech deals and investments in the U.K.Closer collaboration between the two countries’ nuclear power industries is expected to be one of the main focal points of trade-related discussions during the three-day trip, as well as artificial intelligence and the broader technology industry.The U.K. is an important player in the technology sector, punching well above its weight.
		According to Tech Nation, the U.K. has now created 163 unicorn companies – private startups valued at $1 billion or more. Even more importantly, 149 of those are still based in the UK.Around 12% of U.K. startups with $100m–$250m in total funding become unicorns. That compares well with the 14% in the U.S.We have rounded up the top technology stocks to buy now using our TipRanks comparison tool.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
