Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock took a beating on Tuesday after Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google reportedly offered to sell its artificial intelligence (AI) chips to Meta Platforms (META). According to these reports, Meta has considered purchasing tensor processing units (TPUs) made by Google to power its AI servers. This would be a change from Google’s previous business strategy, which saw it rent its own servers to customers for their AI uses.If Google does secure a deal with Meta, it could reduce the need for AMD’s AI CPUs, which could cause server sales to decline. Considering how important AMD’s server business is during the AI boom, this could have a negative effect on the company’s long-term performance and its stock. It would also further split the AI CPU market with another potential major player, instead of just AMD’s main rival, Intel (INTC).While AMD offers more than just AI CPUs through its server business, it also faces stiff competition from Nvidia (NVDA). Nvidia is the dominant player in the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) space, making it difficult for AMD’s own AI GPUs to gain additional ground.
		AMD stock was down 7.46% on Tuesday but remained up 63.54% year-to-date. The stock has also rallied 56.15% over the past 12 months. Investors will note that much of the stock’s 2025 gains have come from its AI business, showing why today’s Google and Meta news is such a concern for AMD.Turning to Wall Street, the analysts’ consensus rating for AMD is Moderate Buy, based on 28 Buy and 10 Hold ratings over the past three months. With that comes an average AMD stock price target of $284.67, representing a potential 43.16% upside for the shares.See more AMD stock analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
