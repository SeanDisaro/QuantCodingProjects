Nvidia (NVDA) stock received a higher valuation from Wall Street as top UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri turned more constructive on the stock ahead of its Q4 earnings results. The AI chip giant will report its Q4 FY26 on February 25. In a new research note, Arcuri, a five-star analyst, lifted his price target to $245 from $235 on NVDA stock and kept a Buy rating. The new price target implies a 28% upside potential from current levels.Arcuri ranks #5 out of 12,108 analysts tracked on TipRanks. He has a 77% success rate and an impressive average return per rating of 41.4%.Arcuri said recent supply chain checks remain strong even though the stock has traded sideways. He believes the setup into the next earnings report looks favorable, especially with Nvidia’s developer conference, Nvidia GTC, scheduled next month.
		The analyst now models fiscal fourth-quarter revenue at about $67.5 billion, roughly $2.5 billion above company guidance. He also forecasts around $76 billion in revenue for the April quarter, above what many investors currently expect.Sales in China are still uncertain. Local companies are increasingly using domestic chips, but Arcuri said additional orders could still add several billion dollars in revenue. UBS therefore expects that Nvidia may exclude China from its formal guidance.Investors have also questioned whether Nvidia can maintain very high profitability as large technology firms build their own AI processors. However, Arcuri sees little near-term risk to the company’s roughly 75% gross-margin outlook and expects management to address competitive concerns during the earnings call and at GTC.Overall, UBS believes steady AI demand and clearer guidance could improve sentiment toward Nvidia shares.Over the past year, NVDA stock is up by 45%. The recent pullback in AI chip stocks amid macro uncertainties may actually strengthen the case for NVDA, especially given Wall Street’s broadly bullish sentiment heading into Nvidia’s Q4 results.
		According to TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the last three months. At $260.38, the Nvidia average share price target implies a 37.01% upside potential.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
