U.S. officials have shut down another China-linked smuggling network that tried to illegally export over $160 million worth of Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips. The investigation, called “Operation Gatekeeper,” led to the arrest of two businessmen. In addition, a Houston-based company, Hao Global, and its owner, Alan Hao Hsu, have already pleaded guilty to illegally exporting Nvidia’s H100 and H200 chips to China and other restricted areas. These chips, while not Nvidia’s most powerful, are still under strict export rules due to their military and commercial uses.According to court records, Hsu and his team falsified shipping documents between October 2024 and May 2025 to mislabel the chips and hide their true destination. As a result, Hsu now faces up to 10 years in prison, while his company could be fined twice its illegal profits. Interestingly, U.S. investigators discovered that over $50 million was sent from China to fund the operation.Authorities also charged Fanyue Gong, a Chinese citizen living in New York, and Benlin Yuan, a Canadian based in Ontario. Gong allegedly used fake buyers and middlemen to get around export controls, while Yuan is accused of helping hide shipments, creating fake stories for customs, and storing extra chips. If convicted, Yuan could face up to 20 years in prison and Gong up to 10. Interestingly, though, President Trump recently approved the sale of H200 chips to certain customers in China, as long as the U.S. takes a 25% cut of profits.
