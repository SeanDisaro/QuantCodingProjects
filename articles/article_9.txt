AI-led disruption is real, but any claims the tech is about to devour all it encounters should probably be taken with a grain of salt. That, in any case, is the opinion of billionaire Ken Griffin, who recently argued that the AI boom is being driven as much by narrative as by tangible productivity improvements.Griffin, who has a net worth of about $49.5 billion and is the founder, CEO and Co-Chief Investment Officer of hedge fund Citadel, added that this take is not intended to diminish AI’s power, but he believes there’s plenty of hype attached to AI, and it serves to rationalize massive levels of spending.The hyperscalers are projected to spend nearly $700 billion this year on AI-related capital expenditure. Is it hype? “Of course,” Ken Griffin said, citing the unprecedented amount of capital now flowing into AI infrastructure. “You’re not going to generate this kind of spend unless you’re going to make a promise you’re going to profoundly change the world.”
		Yet, despite the skepticism, Griffin isn’t sitting on the sidelines. AI stocks make their presence felt in the Citadel portfolio, and recently Griffin has been reshuffling his holdings of AI stalwarts Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), betting big on one name while reducing his exposure to the other. So, let’s find out what’s behind the investing heavyweight’s latest moves.NvidiaThe days when Nvidia was primarily a gaming-focused company now feel like a distant era, even though it wasn’t that long ago that gaming still made up the majority of its revenue. It was only from 2022 onwards that the data center segment became the primary driver of revenue, fueled, of course, by growing AI demand.As it turned out, the gaming GPUs Nvidia pioneered were ideally suited for AI. Their design for highly parallel graphics processing made them ideal for the large-scale calculations AI models need. Nvidia’s years of optimizing performance and memory for gaming gave it a head start, helping the company become a major enabler of the AI boom.That head start made its chips the industry standard, but Nvidia is more than just hardware. CUDA, its proprietary parallel computing platform, has been a key differentiator. Because developers build AI models and applications specifically optimized for CUDA, researchers, hyperscalers, and enterprises become embedded in Nvidia’s software stack. That ecosystem effect makes Nvidia far more influential than a typical chipmaker.
		Famously, the uniqueness and excellence of its offerings have turned Nvidia into the world’s most valuable company, although in recent times, the stock’s performance has been more muted, as the market has mulled over the possibility of overheated valuations and an AI bubble.While Griffin has called out the hype around AI, he evidently does not think it applies to Nvidia. During Q4, Citadel bought 11,739,611 NVDA shares, upping its stake by 120%, a position currently worth $2.2 billion.That move will make sense to Cantor’s C.J. Muse, an analyst ranked in 11th spot among the thousands of Wall Street stock experts, who thinks the stock is primed to push higher over the coming months. “We are still in the very beginning of the next industrial revolution driven by proliferation of Agentic + Physical AI (likely driving the largest buildout in history),” the 5-star analyst said. “So the setup is extremely positive, particularly when we reflect on shares only trading 21x/16x expected CY26/27 earnings… Our sense is that this earnings report will mark the beginning of an inflection point for shares, followed by the latest frontier models built on Blackwell released in March highlighting NVDA’s technological leadership, GTC San Jose in March further highlighting the company’s leadership in AI, and finally a likely Data Center revenue guide update for CY27 from Jensen as early as Computex in early June given our vision for AI lead times to continue to extend given the insatiable demand for AI Accelerated Compute.”With that backdrop, Muse rates NVDA shares Overweight (i.e., Buy), and his $300 price target implies 59% upside over the next 12 months.

		Overall, aside from just one Hold and one Sell, all 37 other recent analyst reviews are positive, giving the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. Even the more measured $261.84 average price target suggests shares could climb 39% over the coming year.

Its rivals have been investing heavily in AI infrastructure, and Microsoft appears to have lost its early AI advantage. While it remains a major player, it is having trouble turning its massive AI investments into immediate profits, and investors have turned sour on the stock, which now sits 25% below last year’s peak.
		But it’s not as if the core business has been struggling. In Microsoft’s recent F2Q report, revenue reached $81.3 billion, up 16.8% year-over-year and $1.02 billion above the Street, while adjusted EPS of $4.14 beat the consensus estimate by $0.22. Still, the results were overshadowed by a sharp rise in AI-related spending. Microsoft’s data center costs jumped 66% YoY, pushing total capital expenditure to $37.5 billion. Moreover, despite beating expectations on both the top and bottom line, the all-important cloud growth fell short of forecasts. That was the cue for a 10% post-earnings drop – the stock’s biggest one-day pullback since the pandemic.Grifin, then, must have felt justified in his decision to offload a chunk of his holdings in Q4. Citadel sold 704,457 MSFT shares, reducing its stake by 18%.Now, with questions mounting around Microsoft’s AI momentum, Stifel analyst Brad Reback believes the company could struggle to reassert itself as the frontrunner in the race.“Given the well-documented Azure supply issues, coupled with Google’s strong GCP/ Gemini results… and growing Anthropic momentum, we believe near-term Azure acceleration is unlikely,” Reback explained. “Additionally, FY27 is likely to have less in-period rev-rec as FY26 befitted from several product cycles, both a revenue and margin headwind. On the spending front we increase our FY27 CAPEX estimate to ~$200B, well above the Street’s ~$160B target. Based on the higher capex we also lower our FY27 GM to ~63% vs ~67% consensus. After years of tremendous OPEX discipline, we believe the company is entering a new, albeit still efficient, spending phase in order to effectively invest in building its own AI tools and GTM motions which is likely to be a headwind to OM leverage.”Taken together, the outlook leads Reback to rate MSFT stock a Hold (i.e., Neutral). His $392 price target suggests he sees the shares as fairly valued at current levels, with limited upside until the next leg of AI-driven growth becomes clearer.

		Most on the Street disagree with that stance; while 3 other analysts join Reback on the fence, 32 others keep a positive view, all coalescing to a Strong Buy consensus rating. Meanwhile, there are ample gains projected here – at $593.38, the average price target suggests shares will climb 48% higher in the months ahead.
