The AI chip wars have just gotten more intense. On Tuesday, AMD (AMD) revealed a monumental multi-year partnership with Meta Platforms (META) that effectively crowns AMD as a tier-1 supplier alongside the industry leader, Nvidia (NVDA). Investors sent AMD shares skyrocketing to $214.45 in premarket trading, a double-digit gain that reflects a massive shift in how Wall Street views the competition.The scale of this deal is hard to wrap your head around. Meta is committing to 6 gigawatts of computing power. To put that in perspective, the agreement is expected to be worth roughly $100 billion over the next five years.The first batch of hardware, featuring custom AMD Instinct MI450 GPUs and next-gen Venice CPUs, is set to start shipping in the second half of 2026. This is a big win for AMD’s bank account. Meta even received a warrant to buy up to 160 million shares of AMD, essentially becoming a partner in AMD’s future success.
