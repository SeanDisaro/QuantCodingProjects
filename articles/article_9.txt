Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) is preparing to introduce a new processor designed to speed up how AI systems respond to users, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The company is expected to reveal the product at its GTC developer conference next month.Unlike Nvidia’s traditional chips used to train large AI models, the new processor focuses on inference computing. This is the stage when an AI system answers questions, writes code, or carries out tasks after the model has already been built.Nvidia’s graphics processors have long dominated the training of large AI models. However, demand is now moving toward running those models in everyday applications. As businesses deploy AI tools for coding, search, and customer service, they need chips that can deliver quick answers while using less power.
		The planned processor is intended to handle those requests more efficiently. Reports indicate OpenAI could become one of the major customers, using the system to improve the speed of its tools.The company hinted at this earlier when it said it would purchase “dedicated inference capacity” from Nvidia as part of a broader agreement. At the same time, OpenAI also signed a separate deal to use Amazon (AMZN) Trainium chips, showing customers are exploring multiple suppliers for AI computing needs.The new processor also comes as competition in AI hardware rises. Several large tech companies are building alternatives so they do not depend as much on Nvidia’s systems. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon have launched their own AI chips, while smaller startups are creating processors made mainly for inference tasks.Nvidia still holds a large share of the AI chip market, but the move toward real-time AI services is pushing the company to broaden its product lineup. By launching a chip built for inference, Nvidia is trying to keep its lead as AI shifts from building models to actually running them in apps and services.On TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy Consensus rating based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating. The average Nvidia price target of $273.38 implies 54.29% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year, NVDA shares have surged nearly 42%.
