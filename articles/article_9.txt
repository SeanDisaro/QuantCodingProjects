Apple (AAPL) is facing a supply squeeze tied to a basic but vital chip material. The issue centers on high-grade glass cloth used inside chipboards. This material helps chips stay stable and move data fast. Demand has jumped as AI spending rises across the tech sector. At the same time, supply is tight because one Japanese firm, Nitto Boseki Co., controls most of the output. As a result, Apple now competes for the same supply as Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN).Meanwhile, AAPL shares rose 0.31% on Tuesday, closing at $261.05. So far, extra supply is not coming fast. The main supplier has said it will not rush to add new plants. Industry sources say real relief may not arrive until late 2027. Meanwhile, Apple is looking at new suppliers in China and Japan. However, chip firms move with care since weak parts can hurt yields and quality. Therefore, progress is slow. For investors, this shows how AI demand can strain even small parts of the tech chain. It also shows why supply limits can shape product plans and costs across the sector.
