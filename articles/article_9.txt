Multiple media reports say that Nvidia (NVDA) is planning to source memory chips from Samsung Electronics (SSNLF). Under terms of the deal, Samsung will supply Nvidia with next-generation memory chips. Samsung is reportedly ready to begin producing high-bandwidth memory chips, called “HBM4,” as early as February of this year and start shipping them to Nvidia.Samsung is a global leader when it comes to making HBM memory microchips, which are critically important for the latest artificial-intelligence (AI) processors. Surging demand for HBM chips has been a big driver of Samsung’s sales in recent quarters. 
		News of Samsung’s contract win has shares of rival Micron Technology (MU) down about 3%.  Micron is the chief rival of Samsung when it comes to the memory chip market. However, Samsung’s progress in meeting requirements for Nvidia doesn’t mean a loss of sales for Micron, with mega-cap technology companies racing to buy as many HBM memory chips as they can.In fact, Micron’s supply of HBM memory chips for 2026 is sold out. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told analysts on the company’s most recent earnings call that the company is ramping up its HBM memory chip production to meet future demand.Nvidia’s stock has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 42 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 40 Buy, one Hold, and one Sell recommendations issued in the past three months. The average NVDA price target of $263.11 implies 41.10% upside from current levels.Read more analyst ratings on NVDA stockDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
