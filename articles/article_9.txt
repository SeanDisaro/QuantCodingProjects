Shares of cloud infrastructure provider CoreWeave (CRWV) have plunged 31% since Nvidia (NVDA) announced an additional $2 billion investment on January 26. While the deal shows strategic confidence from a key partner, investors remain wary of its “circular nature,” alongside insider sales, a securities class-action lawsuit, and execution delays. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors driving the decline.Nvidia invested $2 billion into CoreWeave stock at $87.20 per share, doubling its stake to about 13%, and making it the second-largest shareholder. The deal funds CoreWeave’s plan to expand AI data-center capacity (Project Aurora) to over 5 gigawatts by 2030, with Nvidia helping with land, power, and tech integration.Moreover, CoreWeave gets early access to Nvidia’s next-gen Rubin chips, Vera CPUs, BlueField storage, and AI software. Nvidia in turn locks in GPU demand with a $6.3 billion services deal through 2032, buying any unused compute from CoreWeave’s big backlog.
		Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss kept his Hold rating, balancing CoreWeave’s upsides and risks in its Nvidia partnership. He noted that the expanded deal accelerates CoreWeave’s AI infrastructure buildout and boosts tech edge over rivals, though much is long-term with limited near-term visibility. He believes that Nvidia’s $2 billion equity investment strengthens the balance sheet and signals confidence but is not a credit backstop, so it does not fully ease financial risks.In contrast, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani called the deal “a game changer” that unlocks new opportunities and revenue streams. He believes that this investment, made at a slight discount, underscores Nvidia’s commitment and confidence in CoreWeave’s potential.On TipRanks, CoreWeave has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys and 12 Hold ratings. The average CoreWeave price target of $124.52 implies 66.8% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year, CRWV shares have skyrocketed over 101%.See more CRWV analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
