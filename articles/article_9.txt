CNBC’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer believes smart investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks can be truly rewarding. In a recent episode, he urged investors, especially younger ones, to embrace what he calls “wise speculation” by owning quality companies that are well-positioned for the future.Cramer said there’s nothing wrong with taking a calculated risk, as long as it’s on a company with real products, earnings, and leadership. However, he warned against chasing stocks that have already surged without profits to back them up, calling that approach “a recipe for disaster.”He then named four companies he sees as top AI plays for the long term — Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Dell Technologies (DELL) — all of which he believes combine solid fundamentals with growing exposure to artificial intelligence.
		Cramer reaffirmed his long-term confidence in Apple, saying the company’s strong brand and loyal customers make it a stock to own, not trade.He admitted that “there are endless haters,” but pointed out that Apple continues to produce “the most beloved products on earth,” which is why he believes investors “must own it.”Building on Cramer’s optimism, Apple recently posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. Revenue rose to $102.5 billion, slightly above forecasts, while EPS increased 13% from last year to $1.85. The gains were fueled by strong demand for the new iPhone 17 lineup and solid growth in its high-margin Services segment. Looking ahead, CEO Tim Cook said Apple expects first-quarter revenue to climb between 10% and 12%.Cramer described Nvidia as the cornerstone of the AI boom and praised CEO Jensen Huang for his strong leadership and vision.He said there “may never be a stock as incredible as Nvidia,” noting that it remains one of the biggest holdings in his CNBC Investing Club portfolio. Cramer also shared a light moment, recalling how he named his rescue dog “Nvidia” back in 2017 to show his admiration for the company’s rise under Huang.
		Looking ahead, Nvidia is scheduled to announce its Q3 FY26 results on November 19. Currently, Wall Street expects NVDA’s Q3 EPS to rise 53.1% year-over-year to $1.24, with revenue estimated to grow about 56% to $54.62 billion.Cramer advised investors to stick with strong, established chipmakers, saying he would choose Broadcom over smaller names like Ambiq Micro. He explained that while many semiconductor companies show promise, Broadcom stands out for its scale, steady performance, and proven track record of growth.He also turned positive on Dell Technologies, noting strong demand for its AI servers and higher growth targets. Cramer told viewers he would “sell Super Micro (SMCI) and buy Dell,” saying Dell offers more stability.Cramer wrapped up by saying that artificial intelligence remains “one of the most exciting and important themes of our time.” He added that investors who stay patient and focus on “real companies making real money” are the ones most likely to benefit from the AI boom.According to the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool, analysts are most bullish on Nvidia and Broadcom, both rated “Strong Buy.” Nvidia shows a 19.46% upside, while Broadcom has a 12.91% upside. Meanwhile, Apple and Dell hold “Moderate Buy” ratings, with expected gains of 6.28% and 7.47%, respectively.
