Sony (SONY) stock slipped on Friday alongside a report that the PlayStation 6 has been delayed to extend the life of the PlayStation 5. This report came from MST Financial analyst David Gibson, who published the report with Sandstone Insight Japan. Gibson didn’t say why the PS6 will be delayed, but did say it will last longer than many industry experts believe it will.Even without Gibson’s insight, there’s already been speculation that the next generation of video consoles will be delayed, including Microsoft’s (MSFT) new Xbox. The reason for this is likely tied to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that started last year and has continued into 2026.With this AI boom came an increased demand for data centers to power the technology. These data centers run servers, which require PC parts. This has resulted in an incredible increase in demand for RAM, which has stressed supply chains. The RAM shortage has been dubbed the RAMpocalypse, and it’s affecting video game companies, graphics card makers like Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and other companies in the tech sector.
