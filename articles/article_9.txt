Nvidia ($NVDA) is giving investors another reason to stay constructive on the stock after expanding its long-term partnership with Meta Platforms (META). Shares have been trading near recent highs, and the latest development ties directly into what matters most for NVDA’s valuation – visibility into sustained, large-scale AI infrastructure spending.The companies unveiled a multiyear, multigenerational collaboration that spans on-premises and cloud AI infrastructure. The buildout is expected to include broad deployment of Nvidia’s Grace CPUs, Blackwell GPUs, next-generation Rubin platform components, and Spectrum-X Ethernet networking. Meta also plans to integrate Nvidia’s rack-scale Confidential Computing capabilities, initially supporting private processing use cases such as WhatsApp, with room to expand into other AI workloads over time.Stifel’s Ruben Roy, an analyst ranked in 14th spot among the thousands of Street stock experts, highlights several key points from the deal: first, this marks the first large-scale deployment using only Nvidia’s Grace CPUs, supported by joint infrastructure design and software optimization efforts; second, it further confirms the capabilities of Nvidia’s Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform; and third, it introduces Nvidia’s Confidential Computing, starting with private processing for WhatsApp and potentially expanding to additional emerging applications.
		“We believe that this expanded collaboration reinforces the longer-term structural alignment between the two companies and further validates NVDA’s ‘extreme co-design’ initiative, i.e. evolving from a chip to systems to AI platform solutions provider,” the 5-star analyst went on to add.Looking into the details, Meta has committed to a long-term plan transitioning from the Blackwell architecture to the upcoming Vera Rubin platform, targeting deployment at the scale of “millions” of Nvidia GPUs. While the financial details of the partnership remain undisclosed, Roy thinks it likely represents tens of billions in Nvidia infrastructure spend. This supports Roy’s view that the AI capital expenditure super-cycle “continues to accelerate.” The expanded collaboration speeds up rack-scale integration by combining Nvidia’s first Vera CPU deployment with Blackwell and Rubin GPUs, creating a single, unified AI roadmap. This evolution transition toward Rubin – rather than a full rip-and-replace – is significant, says Roy, as is the co-design element of the collaboration, which underscores a long-term technology roadmap spanning multiple generations of hardware and software. Overall, the analyst thinks this approach is expected to deliver measurable gains for large-scale hyperscale AI deployments, with lower token generation costs boosted by improved compute efficiency per watt.Although Roy anticipates that hyperscalers will keep investing in internal silicon projects and associated networking initiatives with partners like Celestica and Arista Networks, the analyst still expects Nvidia to remain highly competitive through its full-stack architecture approach.All told, Roy assigns NVDA shares a Buy rating, backed by a $250 price target, implying the stock will climb 33% higher over the coming months.

		Across the broader analyst community, the bullish stance is just as pronounced. Of the 31 recent ratings, 30 come in at Buy, alongside just one Sell, giving NVDA a Strong Buy consensus. With the average price target sitting at $266.23, Wall Street sees potential upside of 40% over the next year.
