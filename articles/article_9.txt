Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said AMD‘s (AMD) deal to offer 10% of itself to OpenAI is “surprising” and “imaginative” considering AMD was “so excited about” its next-generation chip, the executive told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” in an interview. “I’m surprised that they would give away 10% of the company before they even built it. And so anyhow, it’s clever, I guess,” Huang said. OpenAI has committed to purchase 6 gigawatts worth of AMD chips over multiple years, including its forthcoming MI450 series, and OpenAI will receive warrants for up to 160 million AMD shares, with vesting milestones based on deployment volume and AMD’s share price.Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
