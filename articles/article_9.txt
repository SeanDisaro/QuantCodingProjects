Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock rallied on Friday after the semiconductor company showed off mini artificial intelligence (AI) workstations. These workstations were shown off during an event in China that focused on the company’s AI offerings. AMD revealed several workstations that were powered by its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor.The mini computers highlighted during the event focused more on the company’s processors than graphics cards. That’s because the focus was on devices that can run large language models locally without taking up the same amount of space needed for larger server solutions. This can appeal to companies that want to maintain an AI for their business without dedicating too many resources to the effort.While AMD’s server business has performed well due to the AI demand, this latest event underscored the company’s ability to meet the needs of a diverse group of customers. These diversified offerings could benefit AMD and help it compete with chip rivals Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC).
		AMD stock was up 2.54% on Friday, extending a 32.54% year-to-date rally. The company’s shares have also increased 2.21% over the past 12 months. While AMD still lags behind Nvidia in the AI race, the demand for its products has been a plus for it in 2025. This could lead to a positive end to the year for the company’s stock, so long as it can keep its current momentum.Turning to Wall Street, the analysts’ consensus rating for AMD is Moderate Buy, based on 25 Buy and 12 Hold ratings over the past three months. With that comes an average AMD stock price target of $184.44, representing a potential 15.72% upside for the shares.See more AMD stock analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
