Welcome to this week’s quantum computing update as the field continues to evolve with advances that reach across many sectors. This week brings progress in hardware, new funding plans, and real-world trials that could shape future markets. Researchers at UCLA and UC Riverside revealed a system that runs at room temperature. Quantinuum is in talks for a funding round that may push its value to $10 billion. IonQ (IONQ) gained another major investor, and other projects are moving forward.We begin our weekly journey in L.A., where a team at UCLA and UC Riverside built a new type of computing device that uses quantum effects to solve complex problems at room temperature. The study, which appeared in Physical Review Applied, shows a system that uses oscillators to solve tasks like scheduling and logistics.Most quantum computers today need extremely low temperatures near absolute zero. This new design uses a material called tantalum sulfide that links electric and vibrational states. When the oscillators in the device sync, they point to an optimal solution. The work cuts out the heavy energy cost seen in standard chips and may help future hybrid systems that mix quantum-inspired tools with classic silicon.
		The U.S. Office of Naval Research and Army Research Office backed the work. The team now plans to expand the design to handle larger problems.Quantinuum, a quantum computing firm backed by Honeywell (HON), is seeking to raise several hundred million dollars in a new round, according to Bloomberg. The talks could put its value near $10 billion.The firm builds both hardware and software and is seen as one of the top players in the quantum sector. Nvidia (NVDA) has been approached as a possible investor, while Taiwan-based Quanta Computer has already put in $50 million for a 0.49% stake.In early 2024, Quantinuum raised $300 million in a round led by JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which gave it a $5 billion pre-money value. The company has now doubled that figure in about 18 months, as demand for quantum tech keeps climbing.IonQ has gained another large backer. A recent SEC filing shows Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MS) now holds about 7% of the company. The stake comes after Amazon (AMZN) disclosed its own position earlier this year. IonQ uses trapped-ion systems and says its new Forte and Forte Enterprise models support 36 algorithmic qubits. The company is also working on a platform called Tempo, which aims to scale performance to handle real-world workloads.
		Analysts note that institutional interest is a sign that big finance sees potential in the field, even as the tech faces high costs and long timelines for full-scale use.Rigetti Computing (RGTI) has placed a 9-qubit Novera quantum processing unit at Montana State University. The system sits in the school’s new QCORE center, making it the first on-premises Rigetti machine at an academic site. The deal includes work on hybrid systems, new tech, and training programs to build skills in the field. Both groups expect the setup to support joint research on hardware and system design.A German-led group, which includes D-Fine, Planqc, DB InfraGO, ÖBB Infrastruktur, and the Fraunhofer Institute for Cognitive Systems, is testing quantum algorithms to improve rail planning. The QCMobility Rail Transport project aims to cut delays and boost network use by applying quantum tools to real data from rail firms. The plan covers tasks such as timetables and route choice. The project will compare quantum results with classic methods to set a roadmap for future use.We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to line up some of the top quantum stocks and other tickers mentioned in this piece. It’s an easy way to see how they compare and get a feel for where the space might be going.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
