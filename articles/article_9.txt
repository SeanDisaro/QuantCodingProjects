Industry giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) are preparing to move portions of their 2028 semiconductor production to Intel (INTC), according to an exclusive report from DIGITIMES Asia. Intel stock jumped over 5% in premarket trading on the news. This development signals a significant pivot in the global supply chain, as American tech leaders respond to mounting political pressure and manufacturing mandates from the Trump administration.While TSMC (TSM) remains the primary partner for high-end cores, both companies are reportedly targeting low-volume, low-tier, non-core projects for Intel to diversify their risks and satisfy domestic manufacturing requirements.The upcoming Feynman architecture, the successor to Nvidia’s Rubin series, will reportedly be the first major beneficiary of this dual-foundry approach. While the critical GPU die remains at TSMC, Nvidia plans to shift portions of the I/O die to Intel’s 14A process by 2028. This shift follows a $5 billion investment Nvidia made in Intel in late 2025, signaling a long-term commitment to building a Made-in-America secondary supply route.
		Advanced packaging is a key component of this partnership. Intel is expected to manage up to 25% of the final packaging for these chips using its EMIB (Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge) technology. TSMC will continue to manage the remaining 75%, ensuring that Nvidia’s most complex work stays with its most proven partner.Apple is also exploring a return to Intel’s fabs, though the focus is strictly on entry-level M-series processors for MacBooks. This marks the first major collaboration between the two since Apple completed its transition to in-house Apple Silicon in 2022. The current move is largely a response to Trump administration policies and the need to diversify away from a total reliance on overseas suppliers.Experts believe this move actually helps TSMC instead of hurting them. TSMC can lower the political heat it feels over being “too big” if it lets Intel handle these smaller, less important orders. This plan also makes it less likely for the government to investigate them for being a monopoly. Most importantly, it frees up their limited factory space to focus on the most expensive and profitable chips for their best customers.Investors can compare AI stocks side-by-side on the TipRanks Stocks Comparison Tool.
