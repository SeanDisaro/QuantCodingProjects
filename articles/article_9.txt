Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock dipped on Thursday despite praise from a top Wall Street analyst. Five-star Barclays analyst Thomas O’Malley reiterated a Buy rating and $300 price target for AMD stock, suggesting a possible 35.49% upside for the semiconductor company’s shares.O’Malley’s updated coverage of AMD stock comes after the company was present at the Barclays 2025 Global Technology Conference. The analyst hosted the event and spoke with members of AMD’s leadership team about upcoming goals and technology, providing insight into the company’s 2026 plans and how it will deal with competition from Nvidia (NVDA).During the event, O’Malley asked AMD Vice President of Financial Strategy & Investor Relations Matthew Ramsay about custom silicon. He replied, “We’ve been consistent in our own modeling inside of AMD that 75% to 80% of this market is going to be programmable load store architecture computing at the GPU level. There’s certainly a market for ASICs. 20% to 25% of a $1 trillion TAM is a big market, and there will be folks that are very successful in doing that. So that’s kind of our perspective right now.”
		AMD stock was down 3.87% on Thursday but remained up 76.21% year-to-date. The stock has also increased 69.54% over the past 12 months.
