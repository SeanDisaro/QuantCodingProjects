American chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) has developed software capable of identifying the location of its artificial intelligence (AI) chips, according to a Reuters report. This technology could help Nvidia detect if its chips are being used in countries where their export is banned or restricted. Initially, the location verification feature will be available only on Nvidia’s most advanced Blackwell chips.Nvidia’s cutting-edge AI chips have been at the forefront of the global AI race as the U.S. aims to maintain its dominance. The White House has banned the export of advanced AI chips to countries such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, fearing that the technology could be exploited to enhance military capabilities through AI-driven weapons, intelligence, and surveillance.According to sources cited in the report, the feature will be delivered through an optional software update that customers can choose to install. It leverages the confidential computing capabilities of Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to determine location. Nvidia has privately demonstrated this feature in recent months, though it has not yet been publicly released.
		Originally, the software was designed to help customers monitor chips’ overall computing performance, a common practice for companies managing large data center processors. According to Nvidia officials, the location is estimated by measuring communication delays with Nvidia-operated servers, providing accuracy comparable to other internet-based location services.This feature will first roll out on Blackwell chips, which offer stronger security for a process called “attestation” compared to older Hopper and Ampere semiconductors. Nvidia is also exploring ways to support those older chips.Nvidia’s location feature could help satisfy demands from the White House and U.S. lawmakers to curb illegal AI chip smuggling to China and other restricted countries. Concerns have intensified as the Department of Justice charged smuggling groups linked to China attempting to bring over $160 million worth of Nvidia chips into the country.However, these tracking demands have also led China’s top cybersecurity agency to question whether Nvidia’s products contain backdoors that might allow the U.S. to bypass chip security. Nvidia strongly denies these allegations. The regulatory issues came up again this week after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he would allow exports of Nvidia’s H200 chips to China. Still, foreign policy experts are skeptical that China will permit companies to purchase them.On TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating. The average Nvidia price target of $258 implies 39.5% upside potential from current levels. Year-to-date, NVDA shares have surged nearly 38%.
