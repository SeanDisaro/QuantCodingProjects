Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock was up on Wednesday alongside positive coverage from a top Wall Street analyst. Five-star Daiwa analyst Louis Miscioscia reiterated a Buy rating and a $300 price target for AMD stock, suggesting a possible 43.42% upside for the semiconductor company’s shares.Miscioscia’s ongoing bullish coverage of AMD comes at a time when the company’s products are highly sought after. The ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom has increased the demand for data center components, such as AMD’s AI-focused CPUs and graphics cards. While AMD hasn’t reached the same heights of demand that GPU rival Nvidia (NVDA) has in this space, there’s still plenty of AI pie to share.It’s not just Nvidia that AMD is competing with in the AI sector. The company also has to battle with Intel (INTC) in the CPU market. To help with these fights, AMD recently introduced its Helios server racks for data centers. These are powered by AMD CPUs and GPUs and come pre-formatted for server use, offering easy utilization for its customers.
