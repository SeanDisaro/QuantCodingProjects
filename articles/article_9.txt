Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock has had a strong year so far, with the semiconductor company’s shares up 33.36% year-to-date. After experiencing such gains, investors may be wondering how much more growth AMD stock can experience.The highest analyst price target for AMD stock sits at $230, representing a potential 42.95% upside for the company’s shares. This price target comes from New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu, who also has a Buy rating for AMD. Ferragu isn’t just another analyst; he’s a five-star-rated one with a 68% success rate and a 19.6% average return per rating. The New Street analyst is also well-versed in the electronics space, covering Cisco Systems (CSCO), Nvidia (NVDA), and Intel (INTC).Ferragu’s market-high rating for AMD stock comes at a time when investor interest in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector is heightened. That’s resulted in gains for not just AMD but also Nvidia, which leads the market with high demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). If the AI boom continues, AMD really could reach Ferragu’s $230 price target, and maybe go even further beyond.
		AMD stock was largely flat on Wednesday, keeping the stock from adding to its 2025 gains. While 2025 has been a good year for AMD, the past 12 months haven’t been as promising. Shares of AMD have slipped 0.69% over that period, meaning it still needs more upward momentum to secure a year-over-year gain.Turning to Wall Street, the analysts’ consensus rating for AMD is Moderate Buy, based on 21 Buy and 13 Hold ratings over the past three months. With that comes an average AMD stock price target of $187.73, representing a potential 16.42% upside for the shares.See more AMD stock analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
