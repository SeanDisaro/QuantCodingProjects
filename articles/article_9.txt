Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock was down on Wednesday even after the semiconductor company fired back against a report that claimed its Instinct MI455X chips would be delayed. The report alleged that these chips won’t see widespread release in 2026, instead being shifted to a 2027 release. Anush Elangovan, AMD’s Vice President of Software Development, rejected this claim in an X post. He said, “Well your assessment is still wrong. On target for 2H’26.”Dylan Patel, the author of the SemiAnalysis report, claimed that production tokens for Instinct MI455X chips won’t start being generated until the second quarter of 2027. He noted that roughly half of the SemiAnalysis’ revenue comes from the industry, and that the industry agrees with the SemiAnalysis report about the timing for the generation of production tokens.To go along with this news, five-star Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis claimed that Nvidia (NVDA) has made huge leaps in the development of its NVL72 VR200 platform. Lipacis believes the product could be ready to ship as early as Q2 2026, which would put its release three to six months ahead of schedule. This would be a major blow to AMD as it would allow Nvidia’s NVL72 VR200 to experience months on the market without comparable competition from AMD.
