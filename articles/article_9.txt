Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock was down on Friday despite the company gaining ground on rival CPU maker Intel (INTC) in the latest Steam Hardware Survey. Results from September show that AMD gained 1.15% on Intel, boosting its CPU share on the video game platform to 41.31%. For comparison, Intel dropped 1.15% to 58.61%.The September Steam Hardware Survey showed that AMD has continued to eat into Intel’s PC gaming processor market share. Over the past five months, the percentage of Steam users with AMD processors has increased from 39.48% to the current 41.31%. Over that same period, Intel’s percentage of processors on the gaming platform has dropped from 60.44% to the current 58.61%.One area where AMD could stand to see more growth is in the graphics processing unit (GPU) category. Its GPUs only made up 17.81% of the total on Steam in September. While that’s well above Intel’s 7.71% share of the market, it’s nowhere close to rival GPU maker Nvidia’s (NVDA) incredibly dominant 74.12% piece of the pie. Unlike with processors, AMD has had little luck in convincing gamers to migrate from Nvidia GPUs to its own offerings, despite significant discounts for similar performance.
		AMD stock was down 0.79% on Friday but remained up 39.32% year-to-date. Even so, the shares have dipped 0.68% over the past 12 months.
