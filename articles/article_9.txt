Alibaba (BABA) is broadening its AI strategy with a new robotics-focused project. The Chinese e-commerce giant introduced a new AI system called “RynnBrain,” designed to help robots and smart machines perform real-world tasks. The news drew investor interest, and Alibaba shares edged higher in early trading hours on Tuesday.RynnBrain was developed by Alibaba’s DAMO Academy research group. The model allows machines to understand their surroundings, map objects, and plan actions step-by-step. In practice, that means a robot could move around a kitchen, avoid obstacles, or work along a factory assembly line.Unlike many advanced AI models, Alibaba released RynnBrain as open source, meaning developers and companies can freely use and improve it. The system is built on Alibaba’s Qwen3-VL vision-language technology and is available on platforms like GitHub and Hugging Face.
		The launch also places Alibaba into direct competition with Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA). The company said its model showed strong benchmark results against Google’s Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 and Nvidia’s Cosmos-Reason2.The move highlights a growing race between U.S. and Chinese tech firms in robotics and “physical AI,” where software is connected to machines operating in the real world. China has been investing heavily in robotics, viewing it as a key technology for future factories, logistics, and service industries.By releasing the model openly, Alibaba appears to be encouraging global developers to build on its platform. This strategy could speed adoption and expand its role beyond e-commerce and cloud computing into robotics and advanced AI systems.Analysts remain highly bullish about Alibaba’s stock trajectory. With 15 unanimous Buy ratings, BABA stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks. Also, the average Alibaba price target of $203.09 implies about 24.60% upside potential from current levels.See more BABA analyst ratings
