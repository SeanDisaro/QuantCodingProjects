Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock slipped on Tuesday alongside leaks of new CPUs that could hit the market soon. Listings on retail websites show off two new processors from the chipmaker. These are the Ryzen 7 9700F and Ryzen 5 9500F. These are budget variants of previous processors that save money by cutting out integrated graphics processing units (GPUs).The prices for these new processors haven’t been nailed down yet, but one listing suggests the Ryzen 7 9700F could cost $294, while the 9500F could cost $218. Prices will be confirmed alongside an official announcement, which could happen soon. Earlier rumors suggested the new CPUs would launch in late summer 2025.These newest CPUs from AMD would continue its trend of appealing to budget-minded customers with its offerings. That has worked out well for the semiconductor company recently, with a growing share of the CPU market being stolen from rival Intel (INTC). It’s also helped AMD in its battle with GPU maker Nvidia (NVDA), though not to the same degree.
		AMD stock was down 1.43% on Tuesday, but remained up 32.71% year-to-date. The company’s stock has also increased 18.76% over the past 12 months. These gains came alongside a boom in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, which increased demand for GPUs and other server technology. However, tariffs and export bans have stopped chipmakers from reaching their full potential.Turning to Wall Street, the analysts’ consensus rating for AMD is Moderate Buy, based on 25 Buy and 10 Hold ratings over the past three months. With that comes an average AMD stock price target of $184.74, representing a potential 15.32% upside for the shares.See more AMD stock analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
