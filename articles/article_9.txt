Chip stock Intel (INTC) got another welcome bit of news from the federal government, who recently put a big pile of cash into Intel’s operations. The previously-revealed deal with Nvidia (NVDA) has been cleared by federal antitrust officials, and gives Intel another hefty slug of cash to work with. Investors’ spirits were buoyed as well, and Intel shares jumped over 3% in Friday afternoon’s trading.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) cleared the way for Nvidia to invest in Intel. Though it did not illustrate any details of the arrangement, reports noted that Nvidia was planning to put $5 billion in Intel all the way back in September. There were concerns that the investment might reduce competition in the market, but these must not have been sufficiently significant for the government to get concerned.Naturally, a deal like this is huge for Intel. Intel has been frantically cutting costs for the last several months now, and an extra $5 billion—which represents about a month’s revenue based on third-quarter earnings reports—will certainly help pull cost pressures off of Intel. Further, Intel can benefit greatly from an association with Nvidia, who has delivered consistently in the AI infrastructure arena for years now. That is also a field Intel has been playing catch-up in for almost as long.
		Better yet, Intel has a growing body of potential customers, a point it also desperately needs right now. Nvidia and AMD (AMD) are both reportedly looking at the upcoming 14A node for production duties, and both Apple (AAPL) and Broadcom (AVGO) are looking into Intel’s EMIB packaging for a new project: a “custom server accelerator,” reports note.One of the biggest reasons for all this interest in Intel is an unfortunate consequence of the market. TSMC (TSM) is booked, and pretty solidly, too; “capacity limits” at the chipmaker are forcing companies to look elsewhere as TSMC simply cannot accommodate.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on five Buys, 24 Holds and six Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 93.32% rally in its share price over the past year, the average INTC price target of $37.25 per share implies 2.24% upside potential.See more INTC analyst ratingsDisclosure
