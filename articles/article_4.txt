Also, Ives views Google’s entry as part of a broader competitive landscape rather than a direct threat to Nvidia’s leadership. Moreover, he continues to list Nvidia among his “must-own” tech stocks heading into 2026.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on NVDA stock based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months.
