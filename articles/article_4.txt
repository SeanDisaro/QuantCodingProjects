Nvidia (NVDA) Chief Executive Jensen Huang has completed a pre-planned sale of shares worth more than $1 billion. The final sale of 25,000 shares was reported on Friday, finalizing an arrangement initiated in March. The plan allowed him to sell up to 6 million shares by the end of the year. When he began selling in late June, the total was valued at about $865 million. However, Nvidia’s stock has since climbed more than 40%, lifting the total value of his transactions.Huang, who is 62, still holds about 3.5% of Nvidia after the sale. He also donated shares worth over $300 million this year to his foundation and a donor-advised fund. Despite trimming his holdings, Huang remains one of the largest individual shareholders in the company.The timing of Huang’s completed sale lines up with a major company milestone. Nvidia has become the first semiconductor firm ever to reach a $5 trillion market value. The achievement came only four months after the company crossed the $4 trillion mark. The sharp rise in share price has also created three new billionaires within Nvidia’s ranks, including board member Brooke Seawell.
		According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Huang’s total fortune now stands at about $175.7 billion, which is up $61.3 billion this year alone. The surge reflects Nvidia’s dominant role in the artificial intelligence boom.Nvidia’s success is tied to its lead in producing high-performance chips used to train and run AI models. The company holds over 90% of the market for advanced GPUs used by major cloud providers and tech firms. Demand for its Hopper platform and anticipation for its next Blackwell chips have pushed revenue sharply higher. For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Nvidia reported $35.1 billion in revenue, up 94% from the same period last year.While the billion-dollar stock sale drew attention, it was part of a steady plan rather than a surprise move. The sale was arranged under a routine 10b5-1 trading plan that executives often use for diversification and long-term financial planning. Nvidia’s sharp climb in market value continues to highlight how strong investor demand remains for companies tied to AI growth.Nvidia continues to hold the Street’s endorsement with a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA price target is $233.82, implying a 15.47% upside from the current price.See more NVDA analyst ratings
