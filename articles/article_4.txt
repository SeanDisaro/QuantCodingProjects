OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman says the next stage of AI may be closer than many think. Speaking in New Delhi, he said artificial general intelligence, or AGI, feels “pretty close at this point,” and added that “the world is not prepared.”That is a strong comment from the head of the firm behind ChatGPT. Moreover, Altman said progress is moving faster than he first thought. “We’re going to have extremely capable models soon. It’s going to be a faster takeoff than I originally thought, and that is stressful and anxiety-inducing,” he told the audience.Altman shared more details on how quickly AI systems are improving. Earlier at the India AI Impact Summit 2026, he said that by the end of 2028, more of the world’s intellectual capacity could sit in data centers than outside them.
		In addition, Altman has set clear goals for OpenAI. He has said the firm aims to build an intern-level AI research tool by September 2026 and a fully automated AI researcher by March 2028. That timeline is not far off.As a result, demand for data centers, chips, and cloud tools could stay strong. Companies like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) are key players in this space. Nvidia sells the chips that train and run AI models. Microsoft backs OpenAI and builds AI into its cloud tools. Alphabet is also pushing hard into AI through Google Cloud and its own models.Therefore, if AGI is even partly within reach, capital spending on AI gear may remain high over the next few years.Meanwhile, Altman spoke about job loss. He has said before that “entire classes of jobs will go away” as AI improves. In a separate interview, he added that some firms are using AI as a reason for cuts that may have happened anyway. “There’s some AI washing where people are blaming AI for layoffs that they would otherwise do,” he said. So while AI will likely cut some roles, not every layoff today is due to new tech.Meanwhile, Altman called for global oversight of AI, similar to the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in nuclear matters. He warned that “centralization of this technology in one company or country could lead to ruin.” That viewpoint points to future policy steps in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
