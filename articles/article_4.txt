Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is often viewed as Nvidia’s (NVDA) main rival in artificial-intelligence chips. However, one Wall Street analyst said AMD still trails Nvidia in the AI accelerator market. Top DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria initiated coverage of AMD with a Neutral rating and a $220 price target, implying only about 3% upside from current levels.His caution is not about AMD’s overall business. The company remains strong in consumer and server CPUs. Instead, his concern is AMD’s role in the fast-growing market for AI accelerators.AMD’s Instinct GPUs, including the MI300 series, look competitive on paper. However, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria described the company as “a marginal AI accelerator player… playing catch-up.”
		His concern is not the chip itself but how AI systems run at scale. Training modern models requires thousands of processors working together, which makes networking, software, and system integration just as important as raw speed. Nvidia currently has an advantage in that full setup, while AMD is still building its ecosystem.Luria noted that the chips may “benchmark great on paper,” but “customers are not buying spec sheets.” What matters is how efficiently large clusters operate. When many processors are linked together, performance depends on the connections between them, an area where Nvidia still “has a hold,” while AMD “doesn’t have a serious answer,” according to the analyst.He pointed to OpenAI as an example. The lab needs enormous computing power and is not tied to its own chips, yet it still appears to rely more on Nvidia platforms and other custom solutions for its largest workloads. Companies running the biggest AI models tend to choose systems that already work reliably at scale.Overall, the analyst’s Neutral rating reflects uncertainty about how quickly AMD can expand its role in large AI deployments.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on AMD stock based on 24 Buys, eight Holds, and zero Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. Furthermore, the average AMD price target of $289.10 per share implies 40.38% upside potential.
