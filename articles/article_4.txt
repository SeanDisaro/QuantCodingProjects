Colwell most recently served as deputy assistant to President Donald J. Trump and deputy director of the National Economic Council, developing Administration policies across all sectors of the U.S. economy. Robin’s appointment follows that of James Chew as vice president of Intel Government Technologies.

WHITE HOUSE DECISION: Many competitors to Nvidia (NVDA) were shocked that soft-spoken CEO Jensen Huang was able to convince the White House to allow the company to sell its H200 chips to China, Joe Miller, Demetri Sevastopulo, and Michael Acton of The Financial Times report. “I think game recognizes game,” a person familiar with the company’s strategy told the Times. Until recently, Nvidia had a threadbare lobbying operation in Washington and Haung was initially skeptical of the “value proposition” of courting Trump after his reelection, a person familiar with the company’s strategy said. After the White House restricted the sale of H20 chips to China, Nvidia was drawn into politics, with the company joining a consortium and Haung meeting with Trump privately at least six times this year.
