Nvidia Stock (NVDA) is dominating the conversation today as the company faces a complex-but-good problem to have. While shares are stabilizing near $191 following a 5% recovery late last week, a new bout of caution is hitting the market. Analysts are currently debating whether the company’s massive growth is finally hitting a wall, or if the Blackwell chip transition is simply creating a temporary bottleneck in its financial machine.New reports indicate that Nvidia stock faces new scrutiny over its balance sheet, with inventory levels climbing to a record $19.7 billion. This buildup has pushed the company’s days of inventory to 105, a level significantly higher than its three-year average. This tells us that the scarcity premium for its chips may finally be eroding. While hyperscalers continue to spend billions on AI, this rising stockpile suggests that supply is finally catching up with demand, which could eventually put pressure on the company’s massive 75% profit margins.
		Despite the inventory noise, major institutional players are doubling down on their bullish bets. Goldman Sachs (GS) analyst James Schneider maintains a $250 price target for Nvidia stock, projecting that the company will deliver a massive $2 billion revenue beat in its upcoming quarterly report. The bank anticipates that total revenue will hit $67.3 billion, fueled by relentless demand from non-traditional customers like OpenAI and Anthropic. Goldman’s analysts believe the stock currently offers significant value, especially with its Rubin architecture expected to drive even more growth in 2027.Nvidia is making a clear choice to feed its AI data center business at the expense of its legacy gaming fans. Due to a persistent global shortage of high-speed memory, the company is prioritizing AI Blackwell chips over consumer GPUs. This shift has led to reports that Nvidia is delaying the rollout of several gaming-related products to ensure its data center customers stay supplied. While this strategy maximizes immediate profits, it creates a long-term risk if the AI spending craze ever begins to cool. This is especially important now that data center revenue accounts for nearly 90% of total sales.Nvidia is currently a victim of its own incredible success. When you’re growing as fast as they are, investors start looking for any reason to worry, and right now, that reason is the $19.7 billion in inventory. However, the fact that Goldman Sachs is still calling for a $2 billion revenue beat tells you that the demand is still very much there.Overall, Nvidia carries Wall Street’s Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell. The average NVDA stock price target of $260.06 indicates about 36.84% upside potential from current levels.See more NVDA analyst ratings
