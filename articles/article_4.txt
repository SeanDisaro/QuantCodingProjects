A consortium of investors, which includes U.S. tech majors Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) and is led by giant asset manager BlackRock (BLK), has confirmed previously reported plans to acquire Texas-based Aligned Data Centers. The deal is expected to raise the value of the data center operator to $40 billion.The consortium, which also includes BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI, and sovereign wealth fund Mubadala’s AI investment subsidiary, MGX, announced the all-stock deal on Wednesday.

It also includes key backers such as the Kuwait Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund, and Temasek, an investment outlet owned by Singapore.
		After the acquisition, AIP plans to inject an initial equity capital of $30 billion into Aligned Data Centers, with the possibility of increasing the investment up to $100 billion, plus debt.

Arrangements to complete the takeover are expected to be completed during the first six months of next year.
		Aligned Data Centers is expected to continue to maintain its base in Dallas, Texas, with continued leadership from its chief executive Andrew Schaap.The deal comes as Big Tech and top asset managers — ignoring worries of an AI bubble — continue to pour billions of dollars in investment into developing massive AI computing power to stay at the forefront of AI innovation.With tech companies and asset managers joining forces to pump heavy investments into AI infrastructure, selecting the right stock is increasingly essential for investors.
