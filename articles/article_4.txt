At Tesla’s (TSLA) annual meeting last week, CEO Elon Musk suggested that car owners could earn $100 to $200 per month if they allow Tesla to use their vehicles for AI inference tasks when they aren’t driving. In simple terms, the EV maker could tap into the computing power of idle cars to process AI workloads, essentially turning its global fleet into a massive network of mini data centers. Analysts say that this idea could make Tesla vehicles more than just cars.Instead, they could become powerful computing machines that help the company’s AI systems learn and operate more efficiently. Morgan Stanley’s (MS) four-star analyst, Adam Jonas, broke down what this could mean if done on a large scale. He noted that there are over 300 million light vehicles in the U.S. and about 1.2 billion worldwide, which is a number that could grow to 2 billion in the next 15 years.If every car had the computing power of an Nvidia (NVDA) Blackwell GPU, which can process around 9,000 trillion operations per second, it would create an enormous global AI network. Moreover, Jonas stated that other devices, such as humanoid robots, drones, and industrial robots, could also be integrated into this system. As a result, this would form a vast web of smart machines that could reduce the load on traditional data centers.
