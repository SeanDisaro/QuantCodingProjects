Morgan Stanley raised the firm’s price target on Nvidia (NVDA) to $250 from $235 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares.  The firm notes it didn’t raise numbers when management gave its $500B Blackwell plus Rubin commentary at GTC or to that entire extent around earnings, preferring to validate it with its own checks. However, after having met with several contacts in both Asia and in the U.S., the firm is now comfortable increasing estimates to get  revenues to that level. While still below the “$500B in 5 quarters” voiced by the CEO at the GTC event, the firm adds that “clearly the situation is strong.” Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
