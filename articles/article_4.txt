Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) might be sitting atop its throne as the world’s most valuable company, but that does not mean its valuation is out of whack in any way. In fact, quite the opposite, says RBC’s Srini Pajjuri, an analyst ranked among the top 3% on Wall Street.“At 24x FY27E EPS, valuation is near low-end of historical range and a 50% discount to 3-yr avg prior to the ‘AI iPhone moment’, which we think makes risk/reward particularly attractive,” the 5-star analyst said.With this in mind, Pajjuri has initiated coverage of NVDA with an Outperform rating and $240 price target, suggesting the shares will surge ~29% in the months ahead.

		Pajjuri thinks the main debate around Nvidia stock right now largely centers on how durable AI infrastructure spending will be, alongside intensifying competitive pressure, particularly from ASICs and AMD.As for the former issue, Pajjuri thinks concerns about a slowdown in AI spending are overstated. Cloud capex is expected to grow 40% in 2026 and 15% in 2027, while the Big Four hyperscalers, which collectively generated over $60 billion in free cash flow last quarter, appear highly committed to continuing their AI investments. Pajjuri anticipates capex will remain elevated over the next 12–18 months, fueled by fierce competition among these well-capitalized companies.Although circular financing deals have caused some unease, these firms have both the balance sheet strength and the incentive to expand compute infrastructure aggressively in pursuit of AI leadership. Only a small portion of their spending is linked to OpenAI, with Meta, Google, and Amazon largely unaffected, while Oracle and the neoclouds account for roughly 10% of total capex and pose “some potential risk.”“‘While an eventual slowdown seems unavoidable, a sharp correction is less likely in our view,” Pajjuri said.At the same time, Pajjuri says AI adoption is broadening, while “compute intensity” shows no signs of slowing. The analyst believes inferencing now represents the majority of AI demand, indicating rapid expansion of AI use cases. RBC’s CIO survey highlights that enterprise AI adoption is accelerating, driven by both cost-saving and revenue-generating initiatives. The combination of Nvidia’s backlog of over 500 billion, rising inferencing demand, and rapid enterprise AI adoption all give Pajjuri “further conviction that current spending cycle will continue through 2026 and beyond.”
		As for the competition, Nvidia currently holds about 80% of the AI accelerator market, which the analyst expects will decline to about 70% by 2027 as ASICs and AMD gain some traction for customers seeking diversification. Google Gemini’s resurgence could present an indirect challenge, although the broader LLM landscape is still unsettled. “However,” Pajjuri went on to say, “we see limited risk given NVDA’s performance lead, rackscale expertise, and full-stack offerings. Rubin systems are in production and should help sustain the lead while Groq offers roadmap optionality.”Lastly, Pajjuri believes the company’s strong balance sheet provides a “distinct strategic advantage which remains underappreciated.”There’s not much disagreement among Pajjuri’s colleagues with his stance. Based on 39 Buys vs. 1 Hold and Sell, each, the analyst consensus rates NVDA stock a Strong Buy. At $263.44, the average price target points toward 12-month returns of 41%.
