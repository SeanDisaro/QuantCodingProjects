The selling pressure intensified after Oracle (ORCL) released its latest financials, catalyzing a 15% downturn in share price driven by rising AI infrastructure costs and a profit outlook that missed expectations. This bearish sentiment rippled through the tech sector, with premarket declines for Nvidia (NVDA), Micron (MU), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Microsoft (MSFT). The downturn also hit crypto-linked stocks, with Strategy (MSTR) losing 2.3%, and Coinbase (COIN) dropping nearly 1%. While Robinhood (HOOD) remained flat, bitcoin miners were also impacted, with CleanSpark (CLSK), Bitfarms (BITF), Cipher Mining (CIFR), and Bitdeer (BTDR) all trading lower. OCC REPORT FLAGGED MAJOR BANKS FOR DEBANKING CRYPTO FIRMS: A sweeping review by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has identified “inappropriate” restrictions on lawful businesses at the nation’s largest banks. The review examined practices at JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), U.S. Bancorp (USB), Capital One (COF), PNC Financial (PNC), TD Bank (TD), and BMO Financial (BMO). The regulator found that between 2020 and 2023, these institutions maintained policies that treated customers differently based on their business activities, often citing “reputation risk” or “values” rather than financial risk. Digital asset companies were specifically named as a sector facing barriers, alongside industries like oil and gas. 
		GAMESTOP HOLDINGS DECLINE AS SPACEX MOVES BITCOIN: Video game retailer and infamous meme-stock GameStop (GME) saw its share price decline over 5% this week as the value of its bitcoin holdings dropped. According to the company’s Q3 earnings report, the company held 4,710 bitcoin at the end of the quarter, recording a $9.2M loss on its digital assets during that period. Despite the paper losses, the company confirmed it has not bought or sold any coins during the quarter. In other corporate treasury news, on-chain data analyzed by Arkham Intelligence indicates that SpaceX transferred $94M in bitcoin to a new address, continuing a trend of moving approximately $100M weekly over the past two months. This on-chain movement comes as the company prepares for an IPO in 2026, per Reuters. STATE STREET AND GALAXY TO LAUNCH SOLANA FUND: State Street (STT) and Galaxy Digital (GLXY) are preparing to debut a tokenized liquidity fund on the Solana (SOL-USD) blockchain in early 2026. The “SWEEP” fund is designed for institutional buyers to manage liquidity 24/7. Subscriptions and redemptions will reportedly settle using PayPal’s (PYPL) stablecoin, PYUSD (PYUSD-USD). This initiative marks a significant move to bridge traditional finance with on-chain infrastructure, with plans to expand to other networks after the initial rollout. KLARNA PARTNERS WITH PRIVY FOR WALLET INFRASTRUCTURE: Payments provider Klarna (KLAR) has signed a partnership with wallet infrastructure platform Privy to develop crypto solutions for its users. According to Klarna’s press release, the company aims to lower the barrier for mainstream adoption by building an intuitive wallet for storing and transacting with digital assets. This follows Klarna’s recent launch of its own stablecoin and aligns with its strategy to integrate crypto into everyday financial life. GEMINI WINS CFTC APPROVAL FOR PREDICTION MARKETS: Gemini (GEMI) has secured a Designated Contract Market license from the CFTC, allowing it to offer regulated prediction markets to U.S. customers. The approval concludes a five-year licensing effort. The platform will offer binary event contracts, such as betting on whether bitcoin will end the year above a certain price, positioning Gemini to compete with other regulated event-driven trading platforms. JOBLESS CLAIMS JUMP AS LABOR MARKET COOLS: Macroeconomic factors continue to weigh on risk assets, with U.S. initial jobless claims rising to 236,000 for the week ending December 6. The data suggests labor market conditions are losing momentum heading into the year-end, which could influence future Federal Reserve policy decisions regarding interest rates and liquidity that often correlate with crypto market performance. 
		PRICE ACTION: As of time of writing, bitcoin was trading at $90,175.90, while ether was trading at $3,195.30, according to price data from CoinDesk.
