Chip stock Intel (INTC), like a lot of chip stocks, is always considering the next generation of development. And with artificial intelligence (AI) looking like the next big thing in development, Intel is looking for people to help with that development in a lot of places. One big, if unexpected, point in that search is the community college, which Intel—among others—believes is fertile ground for that next generation. Investors seem pretty pleased with the idea as well, based on the gain of nearly 2% Intel shares saw in Wednesday afternoon’s trading.Basically, Intel, and a few other major tech firms, laid out the case: for the United States to be serious about leading the way in AI development, it was going to have to see some significant new investment in the American community college system. Community colleges have long suffered under the idea that they are intended for those who simply cannot handle, or afford, actual college. But in reality, they deliver some complete degree programs by themselves.And with over 1,100 such institutions located throughout the United States, looking to them to help build the “skilled technical workforce” of tomorrow is not out of line. While at this point, AI is doing at least some of its own programming—some believe that the Singularity is already here—we will still likely need some humans involved in the process for a while to come.
		We covered, just yesterday, how the new deal between SambaNova and Intel was likely to prove helpful to both sides, but one point got a little more clarity to it. Specifically, the SN50, an AI accelerator chip from SambaNova that represents a system that is actually three times more efficient than the equivalent at Nvidia (NVDA).The SN50 is also said to be five times faster than Nvidia’s B200. This could mean a potential game-changer at work. SambaNova CEO and co-founder Rodrigo Liang noted, “AI is no longer a contest to build the biggest model. With the SN50 and our deep collaboration with Intel, the real race is about who can light up entire data centers with AI agents that answer instantly, never stall, and do it at a cost that turns AI from an experiment into the most profitable engine in the cloud.”Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on eight Buys, 21 Holds and four Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 96.09% rally in its share price over the past year, the average INTC price target of $48.21 per share implies 2.87% upside potential.DisclosureDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
