A growing shortage of DRAM and NAND chips is putting pressure on tech firms around the world. From car makers to phone brands, many firms now say memory supply is tight, and costs are rising. As a result, profit margins may narrow, and some product plans may shift in 2026.Micron Technology (MU) has called the current bottleneck “unprecedented.” The company says demand tied to AI data centers is taking up a large share of global supply, meaning there are not enough memory chips to go around.The core issue is the rapid buildout of AI data hubs. Firms such as Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META) are set to spend about $650 billion on AI gear in 2026, up from about $360 billion last year. Much of that spend goes toward servers that use Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips. These systems require large amounts of memory, especially high-bandwidth memory, which draws on the same supply chain as other DRAM products.
		Micron Executive Vice President Manish Bhatia said high bandwidth memory for AI chips is “consuming so much of the available capacity across the industry that it’s leaving a tremendous shortage for the conventional side.”At the same time, memory prices are moving fast. One type of DRAM rose 75% from December to January, according to Bernstein. When prices jump at that pace, buyers often rush to secure stock, which can add more strain.The impact is already visible. Apple (AAPL) said higher memory costs will weigh on iPhone margins. The firm guided to gross margins of 48% to 49% for the March quarter. That range reflects rising input costs tied to memory chips.Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) is also feeling the squeeze. Elon Musk said during the firm’s earnings call, “We’ve got two choices: hit the chip wall or make a fab.” His comment suggests that securing a long-term memory supply may require greater control over production.The ripple effect extends further. Nvidia is said to be delaying new gaming GPUs as it directs limited memory to AI chips. Sony Group (SONY) is weighing whether to delay its next PlayStation console, while Nintendo (NTDOY) may review pricing for the Switch 2. In autos, analysts report signs of early stockpiling as car makers seek to avoid future gaps in supply.
		Moreover, relief may not come soon. Building new memory plants takes years and costs billions of dollars. Synopsys (SNPS) CEO Sassine Ghazi told CNBC that the shortage is likely to persist through 2026 and 2027. Lenovo Group (LNVGY) CEO Yang Yuanqing also said the crunch will last at least through the rest of this year.Memory makers such as Micron, Samsung Electronics (SSNLF), and SK Hynix (HK:7709) may benefit from firmer pricing. At the same time, hardware firms that rely on DRAM and NAND could face margin pressure in the near term.Using TipRanks’ Comparison Tool, we’ve assembled all the tickers mentioned in the piece to gain an in-depth view of each stock and the broader memory chip industry.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
