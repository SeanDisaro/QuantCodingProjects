Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) shared new details at CES 2026 about its work with Nvidia (NVDA) to bring AI systems into future aircraft. The goal is to improve safety, flight planning, and long-term readiness for more automated flying. The effort centers on NVIDIA IGX Thor, a high-power onboard computer built for safety-critical use.The two companies have been working together since early 2025. Now, Archer plans to use the system in future versions of its Midnight aircraft. In addition, Archer will test this setup at Hawthorne Municipal Airport in Los Angeles. The site is expected to become the main hub for its planned air taxi service in the area.Meanwhile, ACHR is climbing by more than 6% in today’s trading, with recent news as the major driver. 
		First, Archer plans to use AI to help pilots better understand what is happening around the aircraft. By processing sensor and flight data in real time, the system is designed to provide clearer, faster alerts. As a result, pilots may gain more time to react in complex flight settings.Next, the company is working on AI tools to help aircraft fit into today’s crowded airspace. These tools aim to improve routing and traffic awareness. Over time, this could help aircraft fly more smoothly alongside other planes and helicopters.Finally, Archer is pairing Nvidia hardware with its own flight software to prepare for future autonomy. While its near-term plans still involve pilots, the company says this setup keeps the door open for semi-autonomous and autonomous use later on.More broadly, Archer said the Nvidia system could also be used in areas such as manufacturing, fleet maintenance, and pilot training. Overall, the move highlights Archer’s focus on software and AI as part of its long-term business plan, alongside building and selling aircraft.The Street analysts are relatively optimistic about the company’s prospects. Based on six recent ratings, Archer Aviation boasts a “Moderate Buy” consensus with an average ACHR stock price target of $12.40. This implies a 39.01% upside from the current price.
