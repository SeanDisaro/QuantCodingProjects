CES 2026, which opened in Las Vegas this week with its pre-show media events, quickly made one point clear. AI is shifting from early trials into everyday products that people and firms can buy and use. The show will officially open on January 6 and will run through January 9, bringing together more than 4,500 firms across 2.5 million square feet, with over 140,000 visitors from more than 150 countries.Samsung Electronics (SSNLF) led early attention with its First Look event. Chief Executive TM Roh outlined a plan centered on AI that works quietly in the background of daily life. Most notable was Samsung Brain Health, a new AI feature that uses data from wearables and phones to spot early signs of memory decline. It looks at walking habits, voice tone, and sleep patterns, then alerts family members if changes appear. The system is still under medical review, yet it reflects a wider push to use AI for health and aging support.Meanwhile, CES 2026 is also shaping up to be a key test for chip makers. As AI spreads into laptops and home devices, demand for faster and more efficient chips is rising. Intel (INTC) will showcase its Core Ultra 300 Panther Lake processors, which focus on stronger graphics and local AI tasks. At the same time, Qualcomm (QCOM) will promote its Snapdragon X2 Elite chips, which aim to boost speed while keeping power use low. In addition, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) will use the event to highlight its Ryzen AI platform, with Chief Executive Lisa Su set to discuss how AI chips can scale from personal devices to cloud systems.
		Alongside chip news, Nvidia (NVDA) is using CES to stress its role in what it calls physical AI. Chief Executive Jensen Huang is expected to focus on robots, factories, and digital models rather than new consumer graphics cards. This reinforces Nvidia’s position as a core supplier of AI systems that operate in real space, not just on screens.At the same time, robots are gaining a larger presence on the show floor. A new Robot Pavilion backed by South Korea highlights humanoid machines designed for service and industry tasks. This signals that robotics is moving closer to real use, supported by better sensors and lower-power chips.For investors, CES 2026 offers an early view into where spending may flow next. AI chips, health tools, and robotics appear less experimental and more commercial. As a result, the event helps frame which firms are positioned to turn AI growth into revenue in 2026 and beyond.We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to align all the tech companies appearing in the piece.
