Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock is rallying in regular trading despite mixed ratings from Wall Street analysts. The AI company delivered blockbuster Q2 FY26 results, beating sales and earnings expectations and issuing upbeat guidance, fueled by solid demand for its servers.Following the results, three analysts reiterated their Hold views, while Needham analyst Quinn Bolton kept his Buy rating. However, he slashed his price target from $51 to $40, implying 34.8% upside potential. The revision reflects 15x his updated CY27 adjusted earnings estimate, accounting for shrinking valuation multiples in the AI hardware sector.Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated his Hold rating but raised his price target from $31 to $33, implying 11.2% upside. He highlighted that SMCI is the No. 2 player in the Tier-2 AI server market, backed by solid customer deals, ramping GB300 (Nvidia’s (NVDA) next-gen AI GPU) production, and upcoming Rubin chips. Despite this, Rakesh remains sidelined and tweaked his estimates and price target, as he believes that the strong sales growth offsets tougher competition, pricing pressure, and slim industry margins.
		Meanwhile, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kevin Cassidy maintained his Buy rating, while cutting the price target from $55 to $50, implying 68.5% upside potential. He noted that SMCI’s revenue jumped 153% quarter-over-quarter to $12.7 billion, mainly driven by ramping up production of the ultra-complex GB300 systems. SMCI expects steady revenue and output in Q3 FY26 while expanding its “One-Stop Shop” Data Center Building Block Solutions (DCBBS), which speeds up AI factory deployments with full engineering support. As customers expand, SMCI can boost gross margins, and with OpEx at just ~2% of revenue, those gains flow straight to the bottom line. Cassidy tempered his margin forecasts but still anticipates a return to double-digit gross margins.Analysts remain cautious on Super Micro Computer’s long-term outlook. On TipRanks, SMCI has a Hold consensus rating based on five Buys, six Holds, and two Sell ratings. The average Super Micro Computer price target of $42.73 implies 44% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year, SMCI shares have gained 1.7%.See more SMCI analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
