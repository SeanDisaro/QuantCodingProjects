Nvidia (NVDA) isn’t just leading — it’s still well ahead of the pack, according to Morgan Stanley. In a new note, top analyst Joe Moore reiterated his Overweight rating on the stock and raised his price target to $250 from $235, which suggests about 39% upside from current levels.The 5-star analyst said Nvidia still has a clear lead in AI chips, even as more rivals, including hyperscalers like Alphabet (GOOGL), enter the space. Some investors now expect rivals to catch up quickly, but Moore pushed back, calling those worries “overstated.” He said recent supply chain checks show no evidence that Nvidia is losing share.The analyst believes Nvidia continues to offer the best cost and performance setup for AI workloads, which remains the main reason customers choose the platform. Based on feedback from industry contacts, Moore expects Nvidia’s advantage to continue through the next major product cycle.
		Moore also highlighted that AI demand across the ecosystem remains strong. High-bandwidth memory, advanced packaging, and GPU supply are all running tight, and demand is still rising faster than expected. He said this reinforces Nvidia’s role as the key supplier in the AI build-out and shows that customers view the company as essential to scaling AI models.It is worth noting that Moore ranks 240 out of more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. He has a success rate of 59%, with an average return per rating of 17% over a one-year timeframe.According to TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the last three months.
