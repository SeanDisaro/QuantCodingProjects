China has told some technology companies that they will only be allowed to buy Nvidia’s (NVDA) H200 AI chips in special situations, such as for university research and development, according to The Information. This shows that Beijing is taking a tougher stance on reopening its market to U.S. chipmakers. In fact, just last week, Chinese officials asked companies to pause their H200 orders while the government decided on new rules. At that time, officials were even considering forcing companies to buy domestic chips alongside any Nvidia chips they wanted to purchase.Now, the latest guidance suggests that China may have decided that protecting its own chip industry is more important than giving local AI firms access to advanced U.S. technology. However, the government’s message was deliberately unclear, telling companies to only buy the chips when “necessary” without explaining what that really means. That leaves open the possibility that China could loosen its stance later if relations with the United States improve. This shift comes just one month after President Donald Trump said that Nvidia could sell the H200 to China, rolling back some restrictions put in place under the previous administration. Although the H200 is one generation behind Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, which are still banned from China, it is the most advanced AI chip that Chinese companies are allowed to buy. Demand had been high, with server makers placing large orders and Nvidia asking TSMC (TSM) to increase production. However, China’s push to become self-sufficient in semiconductors now appears to be limiting access.
