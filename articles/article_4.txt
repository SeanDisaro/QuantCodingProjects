Way back in the early days of the 2020s, when the pandemic was just getting started, Peloton (PTON) sensed it had a moment on its hands. It ramped up its production in the face of soaring demand. But that demand did not last, and soon, Peloton found itself with excess production capacity and a market that was rapidly dwindling as gyms reopened.And that prompted many to wonder if chip stock Intel (INTC) was about to have its own “Peloton Moment.” And on the surface, that might not seem like an invalid concern. There are some parallels between what happened to Peloton and what is currently happening to Intel. But the differences make all the difference, so let’s take a closer look, with the President’s Day holiday shutting down the markets and all.There are similarities between what happened to Peloton and what is happening to Intel. First, the two are experiencing similar market conditions. Both Peloton and Intel found themselves in a market where their products were in intense and even somewhat unusual demand. Peloton could not keep items in stock. Intel’s product line, meanwhile, is in such demand that some CEOs are calling Lip-Bu Tan personally to beg for chips. Tan himself told the story of some CEOs calling, prevailing on their relationship as friends or long-time customers to attempt to get access to more shipments.
		Moreover, both companies are responding in similar fashion. Peloton bought heavily into production, seeking to ramp up its capability to take advantage of surging demand. Intel also is building up its capacity, and right at the same time that demand is surging.Just to top it off, the demand pressures came, roughly, at the same time for both companies: at a time in which their stock prices were under pressure. So Peloton sought to take advantage of the high demand…and Intel certainly looks like it is about to do the same thing.There are indeed similarities between Intel and Peloton, but the differences, in this case, make all the difference.While both companies are responding to market conditions, the responses come at different times. Peloton’s response came after the surge in demand. It was a response in the truest sense. But Intel’s response, meanwhile, has been in the making since before the surge in demand hit. Intel has been building out its production capacity via Intel Foundry for some time now. This is not a knee-jerk reaction like Peloton engaged in, but rather, a coordinated effort.Moreover, the market conditions that fostered the demand are fundamentally different. While Peloton’s surge in demand was cut short by the pandemic restrictions being lifted and the gyms reopening, Intel’s surge in demand is likely to remain for quite some time. Lip-Bu Tan once again came out to relate that the chip shortage–not just for Intel, but for the chip market, and particularly for components geared toward data centers–is not likely to decline noticeably until 2028. And, even when the chip shortage relents, the demand for Intel products will still remain, even if lessened.
		Intel is also working with a much larger advantage than Peloton ever did, specifically, investment. While Peloton had to commit its cash on hand to build out its production, Intel is the beneficiary of recent large-scale investment from Nvidia (NVDA) and even the United States government. So Intel has a significantly better cash position to fuel its expansion than Peloton did.Finally, there is the matter of Peloton’s place in the market as compared to Intel’s. Peloton makes exercise equipment, a nice-to-have luxury item that can be replaced by a trip to the gym or a walk in the sunshine. Intel, meanwhile, produces chips that are part of everything from video game consoles to computers, including the data centers that make artificial intelligence (AI) possible. While Intel has competitors in the field, which will limit its ultimate market share, it will still have a piece of the market regardless.So while it might seem like Intel is at risk of falling to the same fate that befell Peloton a couple years ago, the conditions are too different for Peloton’s fate to hit Intel.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on INTC stock based on eight Buys, 21 Holds and four Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 70.83% rally in its share price over the past year, the average INTC price target of $48.21 per share implies 3.03% upside potential.See more INTC analyst ratings
