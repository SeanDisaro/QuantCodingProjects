The supercharged growth of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been one of the defining market stories of the past few years. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you know its GPUs sit at the heart of the AI revolution, powering the vast majority of compute capacity in data centers worldwide.Its revenue and margins have become the stuff of legend, and the company continues to break sales records quarter after quarter. Many expect its upcoming Q4 FY2026 financial results, due on February 25, to continue this lucrative trend, especially as hyperscalers double down on their AI capex spending in 2026.Indeed, a huge chunk of this cash will likely find its way into Nvidia’s coffers. Yet, with NVDA shares largely moving sideways over the past six months, does this pause present a timely entry point before the next leg higher?
		Not according to one investor, known by the pseudonym Oriental Trader, who believes that even after trading sideways, NVDA is simply too expensive. “The market is pricing NVDA to perfection to infinity,” emphasizes the investor.Oriental argues that Nvidia’s lofty valuation hinges on one key premise – that hyperscalers will keep pouring massive sums into AI infrastructure year after year. If that spending ever cools, even a little, the whole thesis starts to wobble.And that’s where things get interesting. Oriental points out that the very companies driving that AI buildout – Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle – have all pulled back from their all-time highs, suggesting investors may already be questioning how long this spending boom can really last.The investor argues that the market is punishing the massive capex moves, and predicts that this will cause management to call into question the cost-benefit analysis of continuing to spend at such an astronomical rate.“Recent stock price declines among major tech companies make a broad AI capex slowdown increasingly likely, threatening NVDA’s growth narrative,” adds Oriental.
		Moreover, despite NVDA’s lagging share price of late, the investor posits that it remains elevated with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of close to 40x. Oriental expects that multiple to come down once the expected capex crunch materializes.And thus, concludes Oriental, the best way to take advantage of the AI revolution is to look beyond Nvidia.“I see a diversified basket of major tech companies as a more prudent long-term bet than NVDA at current valuations,” sums up Oriental, who rates NVDA a Strong Sell.

With 37 Buys, just 1 Hold, and a single Sell, NVDA carries a Strong Buy consensus rating. Meanwhile, the 12-month average price target of $260.06 implies ~38% upside from current levels.
