An Nvidia (NVDA) spokesperson, in a statement to Wccftech, is quoted as having said following an earlier report by The Information that claimed that Meta (META) is in line to purchase “billions of dollars” worth of Google TPUs for their AI workloads: “We’re delighted by Google’s success – they’ve made great advances in AI, and we continue to supply to Google. NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry – it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions.”Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
