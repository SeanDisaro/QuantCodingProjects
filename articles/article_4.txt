Retail investors have been active in the market comeback this year, and new data from JPMorgan (JPM) shows many are focused on Nvidia (NVDA) heading into September. The stock attracted $867 million in net inflows from small investors over the past week, marking the largest imbalance among single stocks in the market. Meanwhile, nine other names also drew interest, though in far smaller amounts in comparison.Nvidia shares fell more than 2% during the week, even after the company reported earnings and revenue that beat forecasts and gave guidance above estimates. That dip gave retail buyers an entry point. JPMorgan said midday buying after the earnings call was four times higher than at the same point the day before.However, monthly flows into Nvidia have slowed. Goldman Sachs (GS) noted that notional inflows peaked near $140 billion in 2024 but have since declined to around $50 billion. This trend suggests some cooling in the broad excitement around AI names.
		JPMorgan’s analysts noted that retail activity outside Nvidia has eased in recent months compared to the first half of 2025. Still, retail investors have also purchased shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and SoundHound AI (SOUN), alongside Palantir (PLTR), which drew notable interest, with over $300 million in retail inflows during the week, making it the second favorite name. Opendoor (OPEN), which has been tied to recent meme stock moves, was also high on the list.Beyond those, investors added shares of Walmart (WMT), CoreWeave (CRWV), and Snowflake (SNOW). Each received a lift from retail demand as traders spread funds across both tech and consumer names. Altogether, while enthusiasm for AI remains present, the pace of retail buying appears slower. The focus is still on Nvidia, but other stories are also drawing attention.Using TipRanks’ Comparison Tool, we reviewed the 10 stocks most favored by retail investors right now to give a clearer look at each company.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
