AI is advancing at a rapid pace, yet corporate earnings are not showing the same lift. While firms are spending billions on AI tools and systems, most say they have not seen higher revenue, lower costs, or better output as a result.A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that about 90% of firms saw no impact from AI on jobs or output in the past three years. While many leaders say they use AI, the average time spent is just 1.5 hours per week. In addition, PwC’s 2026 Global CEO Survey found that 56% of firms saw no rise in sales and no cut in costs from AI over the past year. Only 12% saw gains in both. Forrester Research shared a similar view, with just 15% of AI leads reporting any lift in profit.Meanwhile, spending keeps rising. Global AI spend reached $252.3 billion in 2024, according to Stanford data. Many firms plan to lift that spending again in 2026. Even so, Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok summed up the mood well. “AI is everywhere except in the incoming macroeconomic data,” he wrote.
		From a broad perspective, the key issue is timing. AI tools can solve hard science tasks, yet most firms have not turned that power into higher sales or wider margins. As a result, the market is pricing in gains that have not shown up in earnings yet.This matters most for firms tied to AI spend. NVIDIA (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) sell the chips that power AI systems. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) build AI into cloud and work tools. If firms keep spending, these names may still see strong demand. However, if returns stay weak, boards may push for tighter budgets.However, there are some early signs of change. Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson wrote that U.S. output rose about 2.7% in 2025, near double the pace of the past decade. He sees a “harvest phase” ahead. Still, most survey data show firms are not there yet.In short, AI progress is clear. Profit gains are not. For now, the market is betting that earnings will eventually catch up.We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to align notable AI stocks to gain an in-depth view of each stock and the broader AI industry.
