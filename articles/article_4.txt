		Barclays’ five-star-rated analyst Thomas O’Malley raised Micron’s price target to $450 from $275 while maintaining a Buy rating.The move comes as part of Barclays’ broader 2026 outlook for semiconductor and chip equipment stocks. O’Malley believes that closeness to the AI theme will be the key driver of MU stock’s performance in 2026. He added that while debate around the scale of AI spending will continue, high-quality names are likely to stand out.Barclays wasn’t alone in its bullish view on Micron. Yesterday, Wells Fargo’s top-rated analyst Aaron Rakers raised its price target to $410 from $335 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. Rakers highlighted stronger signs of AI-driven demand, pointing to improving industrial and electrical trends and updated models tracking chip production equipment.Likewise, Citi’s five-star-rated analyst Atif Malik hiked his price target from $330 to $385 with a Buy rating. However, Citi removed Micron from the U.S. focus list, noting that DRAM pricing momentum is likely to slow in the second quarter compared with the first.Malik stated that Micron’s stock typically moves in line with quarter-over-quarter pricing trends. Still, he expects memory supply and demand to remain balanced through 2027, supported by limited fab capacity and strong AI-driven demand.
