U.S. stocks closed lower for the week as sharp moves in media and AI names drove the tape. The S&P 500 (SPX) fell for the day, week, and month. The Nasdaq 100 (NDX) also slipped, while the Dow Jones (DJIA) fell 1.05%. The 10-year Treasury yield eased to 3.95%. At the same time, gold (CM:XAUUSD) rose to $5,296, oil (CM:CL) climbed to $67.29, and Bitcoin (BTC-USD) slid toward $66,000.Even so, beneath the index level, the action was intense. Media, chips, and AI deals shaped the week, while health care and energy outperformed and tech lagged.Last week’s top story in the media was Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) choosing a $31-per-share all-cash offer from Paramount Skydance (PSKY), turning down Netflix (NFLX). Netflix then declined to raise its bid and walked away.
		Wall Street welcomed the move. Netflix shares jumped 13.82% on Friday. HSBC called it a “graceful exit,” adding that the move frees Netflix to refocus on its core business while rivals deal with review and deal risk. The bank also noted the $2.8 billion breakup fee, which it said is about 20% of Netflix’s 2026 estimated EPS. Paramount Skydance surged 21.02%, while Warner Bros. Discovery slipped.At the same time, AI remained front and center. Nvidia (NVDA) posted a record quarter, with $68.1 billion in Q4 revenue. Of that, $62.3 billion came from data centers. The firm guided Q1 revenue to about $78 billion. Even so, shares were volatile as investors weighed how long heavy AI spending can last.Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (META) deepened its AI push. The company signed a multiyear deal with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for up to 6 gigawatts of Instinct GPUs. That move came just days after Meta expanded its tie with Nvidia to deploy new Blackwell and Rubin systems.In health care, Novo Nordisk (NVO) said its CagriSema drug failed to match Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide on weight loss at 84 weeks. Novo shares fell, while Eli Lilly (LLY) gained. Lilly also launched a four-dose Zepbound pen priced from $299 per month through LillyDirect, aiming to boost access.As March begins, focus shifts from chip results to software and jobs data.
		First, Broadcom (AVGO) reports on March 4. Investors will watch its network revenue and how the VMware deal affects its margin. Oracle (ORCL) is due later on March 9, yet traders will track any cloud update in light of Nvidia’s strong print.Next, the February jobs report lands on March 6. The Fed is holding rates at 3.5% to 3.75% in a wait-and-see mode. Markets are looking for an unemployment rate near 4.4%. Any clear cooling in the labor market could revive talk of a rate cut in March or May.In addition, trade policy remains in view. The 10% tariff is in place, while the risk of a move to 15% remains over retailers and manufacturers. Firms may give updates on stock levels and shipping plans.Finally, energy markets are on watch. Oil rose this week on tensions with Iran. If supply routes face risk, crude and gas prices could see more swings, which may shape moves in energy, travel, and defense shares.The first full week of March brings another busy calendar. Large-cap names in tech, retail, energy, and finance are set to report, while several well-known firms will trade ex-dividend. Investors will look for signs of demand, cost control, and AI spend, as well as fresh income plays across sectors.
