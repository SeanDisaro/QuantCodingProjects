Recently, Robinhood (HOOD) CIO Stephanie Guild explained to Yahoo Finance that many investors in EV maker Tesla (TSLA) don’t focus on traditional measures like earnings or valuation. Instead, they ask themselves if they believe in CEO Elon Musk’s bigger plan or not. For retail investors, the answer is largely yes, as Tesla is currently the second-most-traded stock on Robinhood, behind only chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). It is worth noting that Tesla often trades like a fast-growing tech or AI company.This is especially true when Musk makes bold claims, such as his recent comments at Davos, where he suggested that humanoid robots could one day outnumber humans and even help eliminate poverty. While these ideas excite believers, they don’t line up with Tesla’s recent struggles. More specifically, in the second half of 2025, the company missed delivery targets, cut prices aggressively, and posted weaker operating results, which caused the stock to swing sharply. As a result, many investors are preparing for a soft earnings report on January 28. Nevertheless, Musk is expected to steer the conversation toward Tesla’s future in AI and Full Self-Driving. This includes robotaxis in Austin, where Tesla has begun limited public rides without a safety monitor inside the car. Additionally, if Tesla secures approval for supervised FSD in Europe and China and pushes more drivers into its $99-a-month FSD subscription, it could unlock a massive software business that turns car buyers into long-term subscribers.
