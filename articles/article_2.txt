South Korea-based SK Hynix’s stock rocketed to a new all-time high after the Nvidia (NVDA) supplier reported record numbers in Q3 2025. The company’s operating profit jumped 62% year over year in Q3, reaching a record ₩11.4 trillion ($8 billion). Meanwhile, revenue climbed 39%, fueled by strong demand for memory chips used in AI data centers.For context, SK Hynix is a memory chipmaker operating under South Korea’s SK Group. Following the results, its shares on the Korea Stock Exchange (KRX) gained over 7% today. Year-to-date, the shares have grown by over 200%.Along with bumper results, SK Hynix said its memory chip supply for next year is already fully booked. As a result, the company plans to expand production capacity in 2026 to capitalize on the AI boom.
		Additionally, the company stated that it sees a long-lasting “super cycle” in the global memory chip market, with limited supply growth at a time when demand for AI technologies is rapidly accelerating.Meanwhile, SK Hynix said it will start supplying its new HBM4 chips this quarter after securing orders from customers. This marks the sixth generation of its HBM technology. The company also noted that HBM (high bandwidth memory) product demand has been outpacing supply since 2023 and expects the market to stay tight through 2027 as it continues expanding production.SK Hynix powers Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips, making it a critical part of Nvidia’s success. Their growth is tied together because stronger AI demand means bigger business for both companies in the future.
