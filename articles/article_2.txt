Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped nearly 2% in early trading Tuesday, adding to Monday’s 4% rally, before trimming gains. As of this writing, the stock was down 0.25%. The latest move comes after reports that OpenAI is exploring alternatives to Nvidia’s (NVDA) chips. Meanwhile, AMD is set to report Q4 earnings after the market closes today, with analysts and investors upbeat on strong results driven by data center and AI demand. Overall, Wall Street analysts expect the company to post revenue of $9.67 billion, up 26% from the year-ago quarter, according to data from the TipRanks Forecast page. Meanwhile, Wall Street expects the company to report earnings of $1.09 per share, up from the year-ago period.After the market closed, Reuters reported that OpenAI is looking at alternatives to some Nvidia chips, with a focus on inference, or generating responses to user prompts. According to sources, OpenAI has held talks with AMD and AI chip startups such as Cerebras Systems and Groq.
		For AMD, the talks put the company firmly on investors’ radar as a potential alternative supplier for OpenAI’s AI workloads, especially inference, which is becoming a fast-growing area of AI spending.While OpenAI says it still relies largely on Nvidia, even early discussions suggest major customers are testing second-source options. Still, the talks support the broader bull case that AMD is gaining credibility as a real alternative to Nvidia in parts of the AI stack.Investors are closely watching AMD’s data-center business for updates on AI chip demand, server CPU sales, and whether supply constraints are easing or tightening. Wall Street expects data-center revenue of $4.97 billion in Q4, up 29% year over year from the $3.86 billion AMD reported in Q4 2024.Pricing and gross margin guidance will also be in focus, as costs can shift quickly with changes in the product mix.Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on AMD stock based on 25 Buys and eight Holds assigned in the past three months. Furthermore, the average AMD price target of $286.66 per share implies 16.4% upside potential.
