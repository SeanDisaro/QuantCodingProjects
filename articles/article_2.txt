Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has agreed to acquire AI chip startup Groq for $20 billion in cash, according to CNBC, citing Alex Davis, the CEO of Disruptive, which led Groq’s most recent funding round. Davis said that the deal came together quickly, just months after Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of roughly $6.9 billion. Groq is expected to formally notify investors about the transaction soon, although its early-stage cloud business will not be included in the deal.If completed, the acquisition would be Nvidia’s largest by a wide margin. More specifically, the company’s previous biggest deal was the $7 billion purchase of Mellanox in 2019. Importantly, Nvidia is well-positioned financially for this deal, as it ended October with $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Groq, on the other hand, is targeting $500 million in revenue this year as demand for AI accelerator chips used in large language model inference surges.The deal also fits into Nvidia’s strategy of growing its influence across the AI ecosystem. In recent years, the company has increased investments in startups such as CoreWeave (CRWV), while also announcing plans to invest heavily in OpenAI (PC:OPAIQ) and Intel (INTC). For investors, the Groq acquisition shows just how determined Nvidia is to defend its leadership in AI hardware amid growing competition.
