CoreWeave (CRWV) has emerged as one of the key artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure providers amid the heated AI race. Since its initial public offering in March 2025, CRWV shares have gained more than 80%. Despite a sharp 43% earnings-led sell-off in November, top Wall Street analysts still predict an 82% surge in CoreWeave stock in 2026.These high expectations are driven by strong demand for computing power, technological advantages in GPU (graphics processing units) cluster engineering, easier access to Nvidia (NVDA) chips than rivals, and higher switching costs for clients. At the same time, issues related to accounting practices, heavy debt loads, widening losses, and data center delivery delays have prompted some analysts to remain sidelined on the stock.Based on the bull and bear theses, top analysts have assigned a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating to CRWV, with 11 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell rating. Nonetheless, what stands out is that these analysts see CoreWeave stock hitting an average price target of $130.50 in 2026, which implies 82.2% upside potential.
		It is worth noting that this high price target is substantially below CoreWeave’s 52-week high of $187 recorded on June 20, 2025. This also implies that the stock has potential to grow beyond analysts’ current targets if it can resolve data center supply issues and strengthen its balance sheet.Citi analyst Tyler Radke has a Buy rating and $135 price target on CRWV, implying 88.5% upside potential. The five-star analyst was impressed by the 85% sequential jump in quarterly bookings growth in Q3 but also noted that revenue was hurt by supply problems and delays in power capacity. Radke added that demand looks strong and CoreWeave’s capacity-related plans remain on track through Q4.Roth MKM analyst Rohit Kulkarni recently initiated coverage of CoreWeave with a Buy and a $110 price target, about 54% upside from current levels. Kulkarni sees CoreWeave as one of the top four players in the fast-growing AI cloud market, which is expected to outpace the traditional internet cloud market. He attributed his bullish view to CoreWeave’s proven scale, rapid time-to-market, and better product value compared with AI Cloud peers and hyperscalers.CoreWeave is well-positioned to convert its sizable backlog of $55.6 billion into cash flow over the next two years. Despite headwinds from the failed Core Scientific (CORZ) merger, infrastructure delays, and skepticism from short sellers like Jim Chanos, about $22 billion of the backlog is due in the next 24 months, providing near-term visibility. If execution remains on track, CoreWeave could generate steady cash from its current builds, but delays and competition remain risks.See more CRWV analyst ratings
