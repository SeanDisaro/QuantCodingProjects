Investors seeking exposure to quantum computing often turn to ETFs. However, not every fund that holds tech leaders is truly built around quantum stocks. Among these three ETFs, only one is designed with a direct quantum focus.The Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM) is the only fund in this group that is built specifically around quantum computing and AI. It holds several pure-play quantum companies, including IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti Computing (RGTI), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT), and Arqit Quantum (ARQQ).Due to this direct focus, QTUM has delivered stronger performance. The fund is up about 32% over the past year, and it has gained roughly 139% over the past five years. Its dividend yield is around 1%, which is modest, but the fund is primarily aimed at long-term growth rather than income.
		The SPDR S&P Kensho New Economies Composite ETF (KOMP) is a much broader innovation fund. It covers a wide mix of future economy themes rather than focusing directly on quantum stocks. While it may include firms with quantum research programs, it is not designed to concentrate on pure-play quantum companies.KOMP also stands out for its low expense ratio of 0.20% and a dividend yield near 1.75%. Over the past year, the fund has gained about 12%, showing more moderate returns compared with QTUM.The iShares Exponential Technologies ETF (XT) is another broad technology fund focused on long-term disruptive trends. It may provide indirect exposure through major tech firms involved in quantum development, such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), and NVIDIA (NVDA).XT is the largest of the three funds, with about $3.56 billion in assets. It has gained about 12% over the past year and offers a higher dividend yield near 7.7%. However, its quantum exposure remains less direct than QTUM’s.Overall, for investors seeking the most direct and potentially lucrative exposure to pure-play quantum computing stocks, QTUM stands out as the clear choice among these ETFs.
