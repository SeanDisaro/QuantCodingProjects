OpenAI (PC:OPAIQ) will roll out its next model, GPT 5.2, on December 9 after a quick change in plan. The firm made the move after Google (GOOGL) gained new traction with its fresh Gemini 3 tool. The latest Google model drew widespread praise for its fast performance and strong test scores. It also came with quick gains in daily use. As a result, reports flooded that Sam Altman declared a Code Red and asked staff to focus on stability and pace in the days ahead. The group also put some new tools on hold so that it can keep its core product sharp.Meanwhile, the gap in traffic grew in late November. ChatGPT’s user base fell from about 106 million to 100 million daily users. At the same time, use of the Google tool grew rapidly. Google said Gemini had 650 million monthly users in October, up from 450 million in July. OpenAI still sees about 800 million weekly users, yet the rise of its key rival is apparent.The change also came as OpenAI worked through steady cost strain. The firm brought in $4.3 billion in the first half of 2025. Yet it also took on $7.8 billion in costs due to large-scale research work and high use of ChatGPT. The group stated that full-year revenue may pass $20 billion. Still, the company sees cost strain into 2028. As a result, each gain in user time now holds more weight.
		Meanwhile, OpenAI said its own tests show GPT 5.2 is in a strong place. The firm claimed the new model outperforms Gemini 3 in key areas. The update will aim for clear gains in speed, stable use, and simple use for new tasks. In turn, this may help the firm keep its lead with broad users and with paid clients.Investors who track the space will watch for signs of a quick change in user time as the new model rolls out. They will also look for shifts in cloud use for each firm. Both Alphabet and Microsoft (MSFT) invest in large-scale AI chips and servers, so each rise in AI use may feed into demand for those units. As new models push the limits on pace, cost, and reach, firms with top AI chips like Nvidia (NVDA) may also see strong market interest.We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to align notable traded companies that employ chatbots similar to ChatGPT and Gemini.
