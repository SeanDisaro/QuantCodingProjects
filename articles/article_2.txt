Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warns that the AI boom may be moving too fast in spending. In a new podcast interview, he said some rivals are taking big risks on data center build-out without fully grasping the math behind it.“I get the impression that some of the other companies have not written down the spreadsheet, that they don’t really understand the risks they’re taking,” Amodei said on the Dwarkesh Podcast. He added that some firms are “just doing stuff because it sounds cool.”His remarks come as AI leaders plan to invest heavily in chips, power, and new sites to train and run models.
		At the center of the debate is OpenAI. Last year, OpenAI outlined plans that could total about $1.4 trillion to build up to 30 gigawatts of compute power over time. Chief Executive Sam Altman has also spoken about adding one gigawatt a week at full scale.Amodei did not name OpenAI, but he described a risk that fits such plans. “If you’re buying a trillion dollars a year of compute for 2027 because you think you’re going to make a trillion dollars in revenue, and instead you make $800 billion, no force on earth could stop the fallout,” he said.In simple terms, he is pointing to a mismatch risk. Data centers take one to two years to build. Power deals must be locked in early. If revenue falls short even by 20%, the fixed costs remain. That gap can strain cash flow and debt.This matters for public firms tied to the AI buildout. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) sells the chips at the core of these data centers. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) are all pouring billions into AI cloud gear. If demand stays strong, those bets may pay off. However, if growth slows, the market could reassess the actual capacity needed.At the same time, Anthropic is not standing still. Reports suggest it aims to secure at least 10 gigawatts of compute over the next few years, which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.
		Still, Amodei framed his firm as more measured. “We’ve thought carefully about it. We’re an enterprise business. Therefore, we can rely more on revenue. It’s less fickle than consumer demand,” he said.In addition, Anthropic said it will pay for 100% of grid upgrades tied to its sites and cover any rise in power costs for local users. That move may ease pushback and speed up projects, which have become more complex as power demand rises.For investors, the broader issue is not whether AI works. Most leaders in the field, including Amodei, still see rapid progress ahead. The real question is timing. Can revenue scale fast enough to match the scale of new build plans?We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to compare notable publicly traded companies that employ chatbots similar to ChatGPT, Grok, and Claude.
