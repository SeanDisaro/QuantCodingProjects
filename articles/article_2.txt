Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has made its new graphics card, called the RTX PRO 5000, generally available. Interestingly, it comes with 72GB of memory and is built on its powerful new “Blackwell” chip design. This GPU is designed for AI developers, engineers, and designers who work on large and complex projects. It’s especially useful for training AI models or running tools that think and respond in real time. This new version adds to the earlier 48GB model.This new GPU matters because AI requires a lot of memory and speed. In fact, today’s AI tools often need to run many different systems at the same time, such as chatbots, video tools, and voice recognition, which can be too much for older chips. The RTX PRO 5000 solves this by offering 72GB of fast memory and very high processing power (2,142 trillion calculations every second). This lets users train and use AI tools right on their own machines instead of depending on cloud data centers, which helps improve speed, protect private data, and cut costs.Notably, some companies are already using the new GPU and seeing big improvements. For example, InfinitForm is using it to speed up product design, while Versatile Media is using it for real-time video production. In tests, this new GPU was 3.5 times faster at generating images and twice as fast at generating text compared to previous Nvidia models. It also helped creative professionals render 3D visuals nearly five times faster in some software.
