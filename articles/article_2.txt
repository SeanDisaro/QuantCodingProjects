Catch up on the top artificial intelligence news and commentary by Wall Street analysts on publicly traded companies in the space with this daily recap compiled by The Fly:GOOGLE AI CHIPS: Google (GOOGL) is picking up the pace of its efforts to compete directly with Nvidia (NVDA) for use of its AI-use semiconductors, The Information’s Amir Efrati, Erin Woo and Anissa Gardizy report. The company has previously rented out its tensor processing units, or TPUs, to cloud consumers, but now the company has started pitching Meta Platforms (META) and large financial institutions on the use of these chips in their own data centers, the report states. The report further notes that Meta is currently in talks with Google about spending billions of dollars to use TPUs in its data centers as soon as 2027. Mizuho raised the firm’s price target on Outperform-rated Lumentum (LITE) to $325 from $290, arguing that Google’s TPU ramps are positive for the former’s optical compute switch. After The Information reported last night that Meta potentially could use Google TPUs, the firm also said a move to TPUs is positive for Broadcom (AVGO) and could be “a modest challenge” for GPU suppliers such as Nvidia and AMD (AMD). Micron (MU) continues to see HBM ramp and recent spot prices continue to be strong, potentially driving upside to February quarter guidance, added the analyst in the note on AI Tensor Processing Units.
		SHOPPING RESEARCH: OpenAI introduced shopping research, a new experience in ChatGPT that “does the research for you to help you find the right products.” Instead of sifting through dozens of sites, users can just describe what they’re looking for and shopping research builds a thoughtful guide to help you decide. It asks smart clarifying questions, researches deeply across the internet, reviews quality sources, and builds on ChatGPT’s understanding of you from past conversations and your ChatGPT memory to deliver a personalized buyer’s guide in minutes, the company said. Shopping research is starting to roll out today on mobile and web for logged-in ChatGPT users on Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans. To help with holiday shopping, OpenAI is making nearly unlimited usage available to all plans through the holidays.CLAUDE OPUS 4.5: Anthropic said that its newest model, Claude Opus 4.5, is available today. “It’s intelligent, efficient, and the best model in the world for coding, agents, and computer use.
