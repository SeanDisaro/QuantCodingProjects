Chip giant Intel (INTC) is scheduled to announce its results for the fourth-quarter 2025 after the market closes on Thursday, January 22. INTC stock has risen over 123% in 2025, driven by major deals, including a partnership with Nvidia (NVDA), strong support from the U.S. government, and progress on its 18A chip technology. However, Intel’s foundry business remains a concern, due to production delays and uncertainty over its next-generation chip technology. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts expect Intel to report earnings per share of $0.08, down 38.5% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to decrease by 6% from the year-ago quarter to $13.40 billion, according to data from the TipRanks Forecast page.Investors will look forward to management’s updates on the progress made on the cost reduction front and progress on product roadmaps, especially for AI chips. 
Heading into Q4 results, HSBC analyst Frank Lee upgraded Intel stock from Sell to Neutral and raised his price target to $50 from $26. Lee said he was earlier cautious due to weak visibility in Intel’s foundry business and unclear growth in its core segments.However, he now expects Intel’s traditional server business to return to growth, driven by rising demand for server CPUs linked to agentic AI. He forecasts server shipments to grow 15%–20% year over year in FY26, well above Wall Street’s 4%–6% estimate.Likewise, Seaport Global Securities analyst Jay Goldberg upgraded Intel stock from Neutral to Buy and set a $65 price target, pointing to stronger signals in Intel’s PC business and early progress in its foundry efforts.Goldberg said demand for Intel’s new Panther Lake PC chips looks solid, based on feedback from PC makers around CES, and expects the company to regain share in both consumer and enterprise PCs this year. He also pointed to Panther Lake as the first major product using Intel’s 18A process, calling it an important step in restoring Intel’s manufacturing competitiveness. While Intel Foundry still faces a long road, Goldberg said early demand for Intel’s advanced packaging should help the company stay in the game for now. Using TipRanks’ Options tool, we can see what options traders are expecting from the stock immediately after its earnings report.
