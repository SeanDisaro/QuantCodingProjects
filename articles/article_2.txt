With artificial intelligence (AI) adoption rising across industries in 2026, the sector remains a major market theme, and many investors are turning to AI ETFs for diversified exposure. Two popular options, the First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence & Robotics ETF (ROBT) and the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ), are both specialized ETFs targeting AI and robotics but differ in concentration and focus. Thus, using the TipRanks’ ETF Comparison Tool, we compared both ROBT and BOTZ to see which AI ETF may stand out for investors in 2026.The ROBT ETF targets companies involved in AI, robotics, and automation technologies. It tracks the Nasdaq CTA Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Index and aims to capture long‑term growth from the expanding adoption of AI and robotics across industries.ROBT tends to focus on mid‑cap and emerging innovators, giving investors access to earlier‑stage growth stories in automation, machine learning software, and industrial robotics.
		Overall, the ETF has $665.85 million in assets under management (AUM) and an expense ratio of 0.65%. Over the past six months, the ROBT ETF has generated a return of 2.62%. Some of the top holdings in the ROBT ETF include Oceaneering International (OII), Ocado Group (GB:OCDO), and Siemens (DE:SIE).On TipRanks, ROBT has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 85 Buys, 18 Holds, and one Sell assigned in the last three months.
