Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has responded to reports claiming that it is running out of its most advanced AI chips. On Tuesday, the company posted a message on X (formerly Twitter) to say that those claims are simply not true. According to Nvidia, there are no supply issues with its H100, H200, or Blackwell GPUs, which are some of the most powerful chips used in artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The company explained that even though demand is high, it still has enough chips to meet every order. Indeed, just because Nvidia’s cloud partners have rented out all their current H100 and H200 inventory doesn’t mean that the company is unable to deliver more. Nvidia also took time to clear up another rumor: that the production of its H20 chips is reducing the availability of its other chips. The company called this claim “categorically false” and confirmed that selling the H20 has no impact on how many H100, H200, or Blackwell chips it can provide.Despite this reassurance, Nvidia’s stock fell over 2% at the time of writing, along with many other semiconductor stocks. Some of the market’s worries may have come from confusion about how the company is managing its supply chain across different product lines. Nevertheless, these comments come at a time when investors are paying close attention to how well Nvidia can keep up with the massive demand for AI chips.
