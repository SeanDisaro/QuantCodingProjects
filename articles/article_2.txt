Chip-related stocks are heading into earnings season with growing optimism, as top Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland sees signs of a steady recovery across much of the chip sector, led once again by AI demand. It is worth noting that Rolland ranks 222 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks, with a 59% success rate and an average one-year return of 21.5%.In a new earnings preview report, Rolland said he expects “modest upside” in fourth-quarter results and first-quarter guidance. While AI remains the key growth engine, he noted that the broader semiconductor cycle is also improving. Also, lead times moved higher late in 2025, a sign that demand is picking up and early 2026 could be stronger than usual for several chipmakers.AI continues to be the main source of strength across the sector. Rolland pointed to upbeat signals from Nvidia (NVDA), saying demand for its next-generation Blackwell and Rubin platforms remains very strong. According to the analyst, the backlog tied to these AI systems has grown well beyond earlier expectations, reinforcing confidence in continued data center spending.
		Outside of GPUs, custom silicon is also playing a growing role. Google’s (GOOGL) in-house AI chips remain a solid demand driver for Broadcom (AVGO), helping support networking and AI-related chip volumes.In servers, Susquehanna’s checks were positive for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), with signs that traditional x86 server demand is stabilizing after a weak period. Rolland said enterprise and cloud customers are showing better buying activity than expected, which could support AMD’s data center results in the near term.On the consumer side, Susquehanna said PC builds in the fourth quarter came in better than expected, helped by manufacturers pulling demand forward ahead of higher memory prices.In smartphones, overall shipments followed normal seasonal trends, but Apple (AAPL) stood out. Apple’s iPhone shipments fell less than expected, a positive sign for its semiconductor suppliers as earnings approach.
		Adding to that strength, recent data from Counterpoint Research showed that Apple was the world’s top smartphone maker in 2025, with about a 20% global market share, supported by strong demand across emerging and mid-sized markets. The update comes ahead of Apple’s fiscal first-quarter 2026 earnings, due on January 29.Turning to Wall Street, out of the four stocks mentioned above, Nvidia leads the group with about 43% upside and a Strong Buy rating. Broadcom also carries a Strong Buy with roughly 41% upside, while AMD offers more limited upside near 12%. Apple holds a Moderate Buy, with analysts seeing around 20% upside.Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
