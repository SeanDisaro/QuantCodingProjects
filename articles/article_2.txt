Several investors are keen to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) due to advantages like lower risk than individual stocks, owing to the benefits of diversification and low cost. However, selecting the right fund could be challenging given the vast universe of ETFs across sectors and themes. Here, we used TipRanks’ ETF AI Analyst to shortlist three ETFs: Allspring LT Large Growth ETF (AGRW), Fidelity Magellan ETF (FMAG), and OneAscent Large Cap Core ETF (OALC), which have an Outperform rating and at least 10% upside potential.Using TipRanks’ ETF Comparison Tool, we placed these three ETFs against each other to get a quick snapshot of their key metrics.
