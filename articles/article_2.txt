IonQ (IONQ) saw a solid rise in its stock price after a clear run of new deals in the quantum space. The stock rose more than 5% on Friday. The move came as traders looked at the company’s plan to build a broad set of quantum tools. The plan now includes a series of recent buys that tie hardware and links into one stack. The set of buys came to about $2.5 billion. The group includes Skyloom Global and Oxford Ionics. Skyloom Global works on optical links built for safe quantum contact. Oxford Ionics works on ion chips that fit well with IonQ’s core parts. These moves gave the stock new fuel as the market took in the new scope of the plan.In other news, on November 28, IonQ filed a Form 144 that shows a plan for an insider sale. The plan came from a senior leader at the firm. The filing notes a sale plan for 25,000 shares. Prior sales took place under a 10b5-1 plan. These sales matched past grants and did not point to a shift in the firm’s trend. Traders often look at sales plans. Yet the size of this plan was small next to IonQ’s full share count. The filing sat in the news as the stock kept its climb, and the trend held firm.Meanwhile, the climate for quantum work stayed firm. Alphabet (GOOGL) chief Sundar Pichai said on BBC Newsnight that quantum tools may hit a key step in the next five years. He also said that full-scale tools still sit many years ahead. His words did not shift IonQ’s stock move, yet they showed that the field still draws clear focus from large tech firms.
		In the same period, traders kept a close eye on quantum stocks. IonQ rose about 52% in the past year. Rigetti Computing (RGTI) rose about 740%, while D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) rose about 720%. Each name saw sharp swings. Each name also fell from past highs. Yet analysts’ current targets point to more room for growth, as the global quantum market may grow from $3.52 billion in 2025 to $20.20 billion in 2030.Moreover, the space now draws more work from large tech firms. IBM (IBM) plans larger units for fresh quantum tests. Microsoft (MSFT) adds more quantum tools to its cloud site. Nvidia (NVDA) is working on ways to help chips connect to quantum units. Each step shows that the field keeps a firm pace. As a result, IonQ’s rise sits in a broad trend that runs across the sector.On the Street, IonQ holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average IONQ stock price target stands at $76.11, implying a 54.38% upside from the current price.See more IONQ analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2025
