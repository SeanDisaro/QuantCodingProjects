At CES 2026, PepsiCo (PEP) announced a multi-year collaboration with Siemens (SIEGY) and NVIDIA (NVDA) to transform plant and supply chain operations through advanced digital twin technology and AI. This collaboration marks a first-of-its-kind initiative for a global CPG company applying digital twins to reshape how plant and warehousing facilities are digitally simulated and tested, with early pilots already underway in the U.S .With demand for production and distribution capacity rising, PepsiCo is using AI and new digital approaches to process simulation and facility design to retool and optimize its existing physical footprint. PepsiCo is shifting to a digital-first planning strategy, leveraging physics-based digital twins and AI agents as co-designers to simulate, validate, and optimize facility layouts before any physical build. As part of these efforts, PepsiCo is using Siemens Digital Twin Composer, built on NVIDIA Omniverse libraries, to simulate upgrades to its facilities in the U.S. with plans to scale globally.Published first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.
