Stock futures are pointing to a flattish open this morning following Nvidia’s earnings report. Although Nvidia posted a strong 56% year-over-year rise in revenue, data-center sales fell slightly short of expectations, prompting a bit of a decline in the stock in pre-market trading. Markets are also responding to a wave of earnings surprises. Snowflake surged 13% in pre-market trading after beating forecasts and raising its fiscal 2026 outlook, fueled by growing demand for its AI-driven solutions. Dollar General jumped after delivering better-than-expected earnings and an upgraded full-year forecast. Meanwhile, global commodities and yields showed stability: gold ticked up slightly, oil declined, and the 10-year Treasury yield remained steady. Cryptocurrency markets held firm with Bitcoin trading above $113,000.
