NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and OpenAI are still close partners, but a much-talked-about $100 billion plan between them is now on hold, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The plan was first shared in September and focused on Nvidia building massive computing power for OpenAI. However, talks did not move beyond the early stages.At the center of the plan was a nonbinding agreement. NVIDIA would build at least 10 gigawatts of computing capacity and invest up to $100 billion to fund it. OpenAI would then lease the chips back over time. At the time, the deal was framed as a major step for AI growth.Since then, progress has slowed. NVIDIA Chief Executive Jensen Huang has privately downplayed the likelihood of the full deal being completed. He has also stressed that the original agreement was never final. This signals a reset rather than a collapse of the relationship.
		“Our teams are actively working through details of our partnership,” an OpenAI spokesman said. “NVIDIA technology has underpinned our breakthroughs from the start, powers our systems today, and will remain central as we scale what comes next.”Meanwhile, NVDA shares dropped 0.72% on Friday, closing at $191.13. While the $100 billion structure is stalled, Nvidia still plans to invest in OpenAI in a different way. OpenAI is raising up to $100 billion in new equity from several partners. Amazon (AMZN) and SoftBank Group (SFTBY) are among those in talks.Speaking in Taipei, Huang said Nvidia would “absolutely be involved” in the funding round. He added, “We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we’ve ever made.” When asked if that amount would exceed $100 billion, he replied, “No, no, nothing like that.”This suggests NVIDIA prefers a direct equity stake over backing OpenAI’s large-scale buildout plans. It also reduces NVIDIA’s exposure to long-term funding risk tied to one customer.
		Meanwhile, NVIDIA has raised concerns about OpenAI’s business approach. Huang has privately cited worries about spending pace and rising competition. Google (GOOGL) has gained traction with its Gemini AI app, while Anthropic has also grown fast with support from Amazon and Google.For OpenAI, the stalled plan is a setback as it works toward a possible public offering by late 2026. The company has raced to secure computing power, while committing to large long-term deals. Sam Altman has said those commitments total $1.4 trillion, far above current revenue levels.In the end, the story reflects a broader shift in the AI market. Big announcements are now being weighed against funding reality.On the Street, Nvidia holds a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA stock price target is $262.79, implying a 37.49% upside from the current price.See more NVDA analyst ratings
