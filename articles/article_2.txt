Somehow, Nvidia keeps raising the bar.The chip giant's stellar earnings for the third quarter have sparked a round of price-target raises from analysts who think the stock can climb even higher.Nvidia, the most expensive company in the world by market cap, pulled $57.01 billion in revenue, up 62% year-over-year. It estimated it would pull $65 billion the following quarter, handily beating expectations that it would issue guidance for around $61 billion in quarterly revenue.The results — and comments from CEO Jensen Huang that he believed AI was not in a bubble — was exactly what investors wanted to hear, according to Dan Ives, a senior analyst at Wedbush."Nvidia's earnings were another major validation moment for the AI Revolution and tech stocks. We also believe Nvidia will enter the $6 trillion market cap club over the next 12 to 18 months as the vision and numbers around the AI spending trend prove themselves out," he wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.Here's the rundown of analysts who are also feeling more bullish on Nvidia's future:Brian Colello, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said he lifted his fair value estimate for the stock to $240 a share due to higher revenue expectations.Nvidia is paying more for input costs, but that will likely be offset by the company's strong pricing power, he added of the firm's profit outlook."We still see Nvidia shares as undervalued and view recent AI bubble chatter as a buying opportunity. Longer-term concerns about AI funding and energy buildouts are valid in the medium to long term, but 2026 is shaping up to be another stellar AI year, in our view," Colello wrote.The new estimate implies 30% upside from the stock's current levels.Nvidia's latest results "answered the bell" as the chipmaker reported robust demand for its GB300 ramp, Jefferies analysts wrote in a note.In the firm's base case, analysts see the Jensen Huang firm remaining the "dominant supplier" in the data center acceleration space.In the firm's upside scenario, analysts said they believed the stock could rise as high as $300 a share as the company takes over at least 80% of the data center ecosystem."Industry checks suggest further upside with beats continuing as Blackwell ramps," they wrote of their long-term investment thesis on the stock. "See increased systems sales with the ramp of the GB200, further increasing the competitive moat."The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating on Nvidia. Its new price target implies 35% upside from the stock's current levels.Analysts at Truist Financial said they raised their estimates on Nvidia partly because Jensen Huang's comment that AI wasn't in a bubble looked "increasingly believable."Bubble fears are the biggest overhang on Nvidia stock at the moment, the firm added."On its conference call, NVDA noted that its A100 chips, which began shipping six years ago, are all still in the field and are running at 100% utilization. We believe this is the clearest indication that we are not in a bubble… at least not yet," the firm wrote in a client note.Nvidia also looks like it'll be lifted by its "solid" quarterly results and strong guidance over the near-term, they said.The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock. Its new price target implies 37% upside from current levels.Analysts at Melius Research said they believed there were four things that mattered most in a note about the stock's outlook:"Revenue acceleration to 65%+ with this kind of margin at scale, benefiting from the greatest paradigm shift of my lifetime is worth more than ~25x next year's EPS," analysts led by Ben Reitzes wrote.The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating. Its new price target implies 73% upside from the stock's current levels.Copyright © 2025
