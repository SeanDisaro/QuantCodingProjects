Major tech firms are now discussing data hubs in space as demand for AI power grows rapidly. First, Google (GOOGL) said it plans to launch two small units in orbit by early 2027. These units will use Tensor chips and will link with Planet Labs (PL) as part of a joint plan. Next, comments from tech leaders drew more attention to the idea. For instance, Elon Musk said a lift from the Starship craft could send large solar units to orbit at a low price. In addition, Salesforce (CRM) chief Marc Benioff wrote that space offers steady solar power and less heat strain on gear.Furthermore, OpenAI (PC:OPAIQ) chief Sam Altman said a long-term plan may place large solar rings in space to keep up with AI power needs. Later, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos said he sees large data hubs in orbit within 10 to 20 years. As a small first step, Starcloud sent a unit with a high-end Nvidia (NVDA) chip to space in early November.AI has raised global power use at a quick pace, and firms now look for new paths. In 2024, world data hubs used about 415 terawatt-hours. Soon, this figure may reach 945 terawatt hours in 2030. As a result, firms now face high strain on land, power lines, and cooling units. For example, a unit fault in the Chicago area in late November led to an 11-hour halt in trading at CME (CME) Group.
		Even so, real limits still hold the space idea back. Launch costs still stand near $1,500 per kilogram for a ride on a Falcon Heavy craft. For space hubs to make sense, firms say the cost must fall near $200 per kilogram by 2035. In addition, heavy space heat, tight room for upgrades, and high orbit risk all add time and cost.For now, space data hubs remain a long-term plan and not a near-term fix. Yet the steady talk from large firms shows how AI demand has pushed new ideas. As a result, investors may see early tests in the next few years, while full use may wait for lower launch costs and gains in chip strength.We used TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to align all the tickers appearing in the piece with other major tech firms that operate massive data centers across the globe.
