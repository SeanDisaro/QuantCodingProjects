Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) fell on Monday as investors reacted to doubts over the company’s $100 billion OpenAI deal, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the deal is on hold. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang clarified while speaking to reporters in Taipei, Taiwan, that the proposed investment was “never a commitment.” He said OpenAI had invited Nvidia to invest up to $100 billion, and while the company was “very happy and honored” by the invitation, it would proceed “one step at a time.” At the time of this writing, NVDA stock is down roughly 2%.For context, Nvidia announced its plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI in September 2025 to build AI data centers. The facilities are expected to have at least 10 gigawatts of power—enough to match New York City’s peak electricity demand—using Nvidia’s advanced chips to train and run AI models.Huang confirmed that Nvidia’s plan to invest in OpenAI is still moving forward, but he did not reveal the exact amount. He described the investment as “huge” and potentially the largest the company has ever made, while noting that Nvidia’s share of the current funding round will fall short of $100 billion.
		Responding to reports that suggested he was unhappy with OpenAI, Huang called them “nonsense.” He added that Nvidia will invest a significant amount of money and stated that he believes in OpenAI, describing their work as incredible and saying the company is one of the most important of our time.Recently, the Information reported that Nvidia is in talks to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT), a long-time OpenAI partner, is considering a smaller investment of less than $10 billion. Amazon (AMZN), on the other hand, could become a new backer and is reportedly weighing a much larger commitment—well over $10 billion, and possibly more than $20 billion.According to TipRanks, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 38 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the last three months. At $262.79, the Nvidia average share price target implies a 37.5% upside potential.See more NVDA analyst ratingsDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an IssueCopyright © 2026
