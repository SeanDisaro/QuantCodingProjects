- Nvidia is a top pick for 2026 across Morgan Stanley’s semi stocks, with NVDA singled out as the best ROI among processors and a Vera Rubin platform ramp expected in H2 2026; the firm also sees Nvidia undervalued on its cloud-computing role. 

- The stock is viewed as having substantial upside by analysts, with a 12-month price target around $258.97 implying roughly 50%+ potential upside and a Strong Buy consensus among analysts. 

- In the near term, Nvidia’s shares have faced pressure, sliding about 3% on a day tied to AI stock weakness, underscoring continued sentiment risk even as long‑term growth remains highlighted. 

- Demand for Nvidia hardware in AI data-centers is strengthening, as shown by Hut 8’s $7B AI data-center lease backed by Google and the broader shift of AI infrastructure toward Nvidia GPUs powering deployments like CoreWeave. 

- Competitive dynamics are evolving, with Google/Meta exploring TPU adoption to reduce Nvidia GPU dependence; while Nvidia currently leads AI GPU demand vs AMD, TPU-focused ecosystems could pose longer‑term headwinds.
