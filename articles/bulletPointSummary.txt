- Apollo Global Management (APO) is nearing a $3.4 billion loan to a Valor Equity Partners–arranged vehicle that will buy Nvidia (NVDA) chips and lease them to Elon Musk’s xAI; this would be APO’s second large financing tied to xAI, following a $3.5 billion loan last November.
- The deal includes plans to raise about $5.3 billion in total debt and equity for the vehicle, aiming to give xAI access to AI hardware without paying the full upfront cost; the loan carries about 9.5% interest and could yield over 22% annual returns in favorable scenarios.
- The financing highlights the growing role of private credit in funding AI hardware, with Nvidia GPUs at the center of these deployments to support xAI’s data-center expansion.
- Market reaction cites a Strong Buy consensus for APO, with an average price target of around $163.70 and upside of roughly 19–19.3%, reflecting enthusiasm around Nvidia ecosystem–related financings.
- OpenAI concerns previously weighed on Nvidia, but renewed confidence in OpenAI’s long-term outlook and its partnerships could provide valuation upside for Nvidia and other Nvidia-connected stocks as those ties strengthen.
