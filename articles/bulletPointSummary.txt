- Nvidia posted record Q3 revenue of $57 billion, with Data Center sales at $51.2 billion driven by Blackwell GPUs, and cloud GPUs remaining sold out, signaling strong ongoing demand.
- The company has a massive $500 billion backlog for its Blackwell and Rubin chips, providing high revenue visibility across the next six quarters into early 2027.
- Nvidia holds an estimated 90% share of data-center GPUs and is well-positioned to capture a large portion of the growing AI data-center spend, projected to reach $3–4 trillion annually by 2030.
- Wall Street remains bullish, with a Strong Buy consensus and an average target around $258 (roughly 40–43% upside), plus potential upside from China-market re-entry for AI chips.
- Nvidia’s ecosystem and product roadmap reinforce leadership: Rubin and Blackwell Ultra developments, resumed China shipments of H200, CUDA-driven software moat, and cloud deployments (e.g., Runway powered via CoreWeave) supporting expansive AI workloads.
