- Nvidia remains a central player in AI data-center expansion, with Bank of America naming it a top semiconductor pick and a price target of $275, implying about 38% upside.

- At the GPU Technology Conference, Nvidia highlighted robust AI infrastructure demand, noting roughly $500 billion in data-center orders expected for 2025–2026, underpinning continued growth.

- Long-term bull case suggests Nvidia could earn more than $40 per share if global AI spending by 2030 reaches trillions, with the stock potentially trading at far less than that growth implies (around a 5x earnings multiple in that scenario).

- Nvidia is widely viewed as the market leader in AI GPUs, holding a dominant share (over 90%) in the AI data-center segment, reinforcing its competitive position amid rivals like AMD.

- On the near term, Nvidia stock has experienced volatility, including a roughly 3% dip in one session after SoftBank disclosed exiting its position, highlighting market sensitivity to news flow and portfolio moves.
