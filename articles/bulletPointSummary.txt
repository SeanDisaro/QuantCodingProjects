- NVIDIA Jetson AGX Thor debuts as an edge AI robotics platform: delivers up to 2,070 FP4 teraflops of AI compute at a 130-watt envelope, with 128 GB memory and about 7.5x higher AI compute vs Jetson Orin. 

- Early adopters across robotics and industrial sectors are on board: Agility Robotics, Amazon Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar, Figure, Hexagon, Medtronic, and Meta are evaluating or using Jetson Thor, leveraging NVIDIA’s full edge software stack (Jetson, Isaac, Metropolis, Holoscan).

- Analysts are increasingly optimistic about NVDA stock on AI-driven demand and new product cycles: targets cited include $225 (26% upside) from Baird for GB300 timing, with other reports showing upside estimates in the teens to high teens percent ranges.

- NVDA’s data-center and networking momentum continues: Spectrum-X adoption by cloud providers and partners (e.g., Meta, xAI) and the expansion of ConnectX-8 chips targeting the AI server market, along with the Nvidia Cloud Partners program.

- Real-world GPU demand is broadening beyond the data center: IREN is expanding its NVIDIA Blackwell GPU fleet to about 8.5k units (4.2k additional GPUs, ~ $193 million), financed via a 36-month lease, highlighting growing AI-cloud capacity and related compute demand.
