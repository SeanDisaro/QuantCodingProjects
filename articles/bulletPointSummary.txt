- NVIDIA released the beta of Newton, an open-source GPU-accelerated physics engine, integrated into NVIDIA Isaac Lab to accelerate robotics development and real-world transfer from simulation.

- The new Isaac GR00T N1.6 robot foundation model adds Cosmos Reason, a reasoning vision-language brain that turns vague instructions into step-by-step plans using prior knowledge and physics.

- New Cosmos World Foundation Models (WFMs) expand data-generation capabilities for physical AI training, enabling scalable data creation across text, image, and video prompts, with support from NVIDIA Cosmos Reason for reasoning tasks.

- Isaac Lab 2.3 introduces a dexterous grasping workflow for multi-fingered hands and arms, trained in virtual environments with automated curricula; the workflow is being used by leading developers (e.g., Boston Dynamics’ Atlas) to improve manipulation in unpredictable settings; NVIDIA is also promoting an open Isaac Lab – Arena framework for scalable policy evaluation.

- The OpenAI-NVIDIA partnership is expanding, with plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI data centers (initial deployment of $10 billion) to support growing compute demand; this collaboration supports a bull case for NVIDIA, reinforced by bullish price targets (approximately $212–$240 in various analyst notes) and Strong Buy ratings across multiple firms.
