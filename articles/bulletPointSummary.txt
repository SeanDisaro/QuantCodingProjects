- Nvidia posted strong quarterly results with revenue of $57 billion (up 62% YoY) and gross margins above 73%, plus guidance for about $65 billion in revenue next quarter. 

- Demand for Nvidia’s high-end H200 AI chips remains tight, with plans to boost output under consideration; exports to China could be allowed with a 25% tariff, though approvals are pending and supply remains constrained.

- The stock enjoys a firm Strong Buy consensus from analysts, with an average target around $258.45, implying roughly 42%–48% upside over the next 12 months.

- Nvidia’s leadership in data-center GPUs and its growing ecosystem (including partnerships with Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic) support expectations for continued AI infrastructure demand and margin expansion, aided by new products like Blackwell GPUs.

- Risks include questions about the real-world monetization of AI spending, potential competitive pressure (e.g., Gemini 3), and policy or geopolitical factors (notably U.S.-China export dynamics) that could temper demand or supply.
