- Nvidia has surged about 48% this year on strong AI data-center GPU demand (H100 and Blackwell), with Q3 FY2026 results anticipated (EPS around $1.25, revenue about $54.6B) and continued orders from cloud customers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet; investors will watch for demand durability if tech spending slows.

- Bulls are prominent: Bank of America has a Buy rating with a $275 target (roughly 46% upside); Loop Capital targets $350 (about 76% upside) and sees GPU shipments nearly doubling; the Street-wide Strong Buy consensus sits at 37 Buys, 1 Hold, 1 Sell, with an average target around $237.21 (~19% upside). Nvidia also reportedly has about $500B in data-center orders for 2025–2026, signaling strong demand visibility.

- Nvidia’s leadership in AI data-center chips remains a core driver, with dominance cited at over 90% market share even as competitors like AMD gain ground; AMD projects huge AI data-center growth, but Nvidia is still the premier supplier for AI workloads.

- Institutional moves highlight Nvidia’s prominence: Citigroup’s largest holding is Nvidia (about 33.3 million shares worth roughly $6.6B), underscoring its role in big portfolios; SoftBank disclosed selling its entire Nvidia stake for about $5.8B, reflecting shifting AI-investment allocations.

- Nvidia is a common top holding in AI/tech-focused ETFs (e.g., First Trust BuyWrite Income ETF, PTNQ, SFY), illustrating broad market exposure to Nvidia as a keystone AI name.
