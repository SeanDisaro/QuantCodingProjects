- Nvidia is back in the spotlight as analysts lift price targets ahead of the Q2 earnings report on August 27, underscoring strong AI demand, market dominance, and easing U.S. export rules.

- Price targets have been raised: KeyBanc’s John Vinh to $215; Susquehanna’s Christopher Rolland to $210, both with Buy ratings; the Street’s consensus (Strong Buy) sits around $196.65 with roughly 12% upside from current levels.

- China revenue potential remains a factor: Nvidia’s forecast may exclude China due to license delays, but including China could add roughly $2–$3 billion in revenue from H20 and RTX6000D chips.

- Data-center momentum and new GB300/GB200 product lines are expected to drive double-digit revenue growth, supported by higher selling prices and stronger margins.

- Option activity and sentiment support optimism: Nvidia is among the biggest growth names in Wednesday’s option flow, and UBS/Oppenheimer price targets (e.g., $205 and $200) reinforce a bullish stance; current price around the mid-to-high $170s suggests meaningful upside.
