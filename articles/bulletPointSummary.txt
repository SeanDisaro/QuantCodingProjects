- Nvidia remains the global leader in AI chips, but U.S. export controls have driven China’s Nvidia market share down to near 0% as domestic players like Huawei gain ground; Huang warns against underestimating China’s AI push, signaling continued long‑term demand but evolving regional dynamics.

- A U.S. export license lets Microsoft ship about 60,400 A100‑class Nvidia chips (including GB300 processors) to UAE AI data centers, with a broader trend of selective export policies that still support international AI expansion while keeping some Nvidia products (like Blackwell) US‑restricted.

- Major GB300 GPU demand is materializing in large-scale partnerships, such as IREN’s Microsoft deal worth about $9.7 billion (plus a $5.8 billion Dell deal for GPUs and related equipment), with deployment planned across a 750‑MW Texas campus and multi‑year rollout through 2026.

- Analysts remain upbeat on Nvidia, with a Strong Buy consensus and an average price target around $237.14, implying roughly a 17% upside from current levels, signaling sustained optimistic sentiment about the stock.

- Nvidia is drawing notable market attention in options activity, with Friday’s session showing high total option volume and NVDA among the leading movers, suggesting robust investor interest and potential volatility around the name.
