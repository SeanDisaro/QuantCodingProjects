- The stock carries a strong buy consensus among analysts (roughly 37 buys, 1 hold, 1 sell in the recent period), with the $260.06 target implying meaningful upside.

- Wolfe Research places Nvidia on its Alpha List and points to a strong long-term growth outlook driven by upcoming Rubin and Rubin Ultra platforms, expecting higher earnings for 2026–2028 and valuing the stock around 16x forward earnings (target near $260).
