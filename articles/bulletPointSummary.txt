- Nvidia posted strong Q2 results: revenue about $46.7B (up 56% YoY) and data-center revenue $41.1B (also up 56%), underscoring robust AI infrastructure demand.
- Despite the beat, the stock traded lower in pre-market action and guidance for the next quarter was around $54B, signaling a mixed near-term market reaction.
- Analysts remain broadly bullish with price targets near $200–$210 and a strong Buy consensus (e.g., several price targets around $205–$209; some reports noting upside around 12–15%).
- AI infrastructure spend remains a key driver: Huang expects $3–4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by year-end of the decade; Nvidia’s chips remain in tight supply, with potential H20 revenue in China contingent on licensing.
- There was notable bullish activity in NVDA options, including large positions in 8/29 weekly 200 calls, signaling continued investor optimism.
