- Nvidia’s latest quarter beat on both revenue and earnings with positive guidance, but Data Center growth was only 5% sequentially and Compute declined 1%, signaling a softer near-term AI demand backdrop.
- The stock remains broadly favored by analysts, with a Strong Buy consensus and 12-month targets around $209–$213, implying roughly 20%+ upside; one bearish target as low as $100 exists.
- Regulatory and geopolitical headwinds loom, including US restrictions on AI/chip exports to China and ongoing delays in obtaining necessary approvals, which could restrain China demand.
- Revenue concentration risk is rising, as two unnamed direct customers accounted for a substantial share of revenue, underscoring potential volatility from large buyers’ spending shifts.
- Retail investor interest has been strong but cooling overall; Nvidia still attracts notable weekly inflows, reflecting continued enthusiasm for AI names while broader AI hype shows signs of moderation.
