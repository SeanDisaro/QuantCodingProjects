- Nvidia has stated there are no supply issues with its H100, H200, or Blackwell GPUs; cloud partners can rent existing stock and selling the H20 does not reduce supply of other Nvidia products. 
- Wall Street remains upbeat with a Strong Buy consensus on NVDA (34 Buys, 3 Holds, 1 Sell in the past 3 months) and an average price target of about $210.75, implying roughly 24.5% upside potential.
- Despite the reassurances, Nvidia’s stock fell more than 2% at the time of the report, signaling investor caution around supply-chain dynamics and demand in AI chips.
- Nvidia sits within a broader AI/robotics expansion, including Runway AI’s shift into robotics and autonomous training—with Runway backed by Nvidia and Alphabet—highlighting potential overlap and competition in AI-driven simulation and training environments.
- The market faces concentration risk with Nvidia accounting for a sizable share of the S&P 500 (around 8%), which could pose risks if Nvidia hits a setback, even as growth fundamentals and AI-driven demand support optimism.
