- Nvidia remains the leader in AI infrastructure, with analysts showing strong conviction and price targets around the high $250s, implying roughly 42% upside over the next year.

- Despite competition signals from Google (TPUs) and Meta, Nvidia is seen as essential to AI compute demand; several notes describe the AI revolution as starting and ending with Nvidia and keep the stock as a must-own for many strategists.

- Regulatory and geopolitical risks loom for NVDA’s China business, including a ban on new data-center Nvidia chips in China; some potential recovery could come from newer products like the H200, but China exposure remains a headwind.

- Real-world deployment and demand for Nvidia GPUs continue to grow: large-scale compute projects (e.g., AlphaTON’s 1,000+ GPU cluster) and ongoing data-center investments are highlighted, with projections of multi-million GPU shipments in coming years (e.g., around 8 million GPUs in 2027 if supply holds).

- Sentiment remains resilient despite headlines about alternatives (e.g., TPUs) and market volatility; vendor-financing scrutiny is noted, but Nvidia’s revenue model and transparency are emphasized as sound by multiple analysts and commentators.
