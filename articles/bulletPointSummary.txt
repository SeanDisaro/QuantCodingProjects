- Nvidia halted H20 AI chip production for China over security concerns and is pursuing a modified Blackwell design (lower power, ~80% of top performance) to try to win regulatory approval; China remains a key market with potential Chinese AI-chip spend estimated by analysts at over $15B, while a 15% of H20 revenue would need to go to the US Treasury if licenses are granted.

- The stock remains very buoyant on Wall Street, with a Strong Buy consensus across analysts (roughly 35+ buys vs. a few holds/sells); average price targets are in the high-$190s to low-$200s, implying about 11%–12% upside (some reports note up to ~14%).

- Ahead of the Q2 FY26 results, analysts expect roughly $1.01 EPS on about $45.9B in revenue; demand from AI/data-center workloads is strong, though China-related sales may be excluded from guidance pending license clearances.

- Valuation remains rich but supported by growth: forward P/E around the low- to mid-30s (with some commentary noting it’s high but justified by rapid earnings growth), and targets imply modest single-digit to low-double-digit upside relative to current levels.

- Near-term catalysts include the rollout of next-generation GPUs (Blackwell/Ultra, GB300) and continued AI demand momentum; supply is largely sold out for the coming year, which underpins growth but adds sensitivity to regulatory and China-related developments.
