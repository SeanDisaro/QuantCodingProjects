- Nvidia H200 shipments to China are subject to a U.S. national-security review and cross-border routing (Taiwan manufacturing to the U.S. for review before final export to China).  
- China is considering tight controls on Nvidia’s H200 access, including buyer approvals and potential restrictions on government departments purchasing the chips.  
- The U.S. posture could let Nvidia’s H200 exports to China proceed with a 25% fee to the U.S. government, a policy approach that could extend to other American chipmakers too.  
- Nvidia’s GB300 ultra‑superchip (Grace CPU paired with two Blackwell Ultra GPUs) is driving large‑scale AI workloads and is featured in major AI infrastructure deals (e.g., IREN’s Microsoft partnership).  
- The demand for NVDA‑related memory/DRAM is expected to grow (Rubin Ultra’s DRAM needs), signaling positive ripple effects for Nvidia’s ecosystem and AI hardware demand.
