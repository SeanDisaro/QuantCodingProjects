- Nvidia is bolstering OpenAI’s AI infra with a strategic partnership and an investment of up to $100 billion to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, with the first phase online in 2H 2026 and the Vera Rubin platform underpinning the rollout. OpenAI is positioned as a preferred compute partner.

- The market sentiment on NVDA remains bullish, with a Strong Buy consensus from Wall Street (example: about 36 Buys, 2 Holds, 1 Sell in the past three months) and an average price target near $211.61, implying roughly 15% upside. Other notes show targets in the $210–$235 range.

- The deal is framed by analysts as potentially massive in revenue terms, with estimates like $300 billion to $500 billion in revenue over time (roughly 3–5x ROI) linked to Nvidia’s role in powering OpenAI’s AI data centers.

- While optimistic, there are caveats: concerns that Nvidia could be viewed as the “investor of last resort” for OpenAI, potential accounting/regulatory questions around such a large investment, and ongoing competition from Broadcom, AMD, and other chipmakers.

- The collaboration ecosystem is expanding beyond OpenAI, with real-world GPU demand evidenced by large GPU purchases (e.g., IREN’s $670 million Nvidia/AMD GPU procurement) and related partnerships and initiatives (joint labs in the Middle East, Google TV Gemini integration, cloud and enterprise collaborations), reinforcing Nvidia’s growth trajectory in AI compute.
