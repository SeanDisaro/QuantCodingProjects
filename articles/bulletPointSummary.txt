- Nvidia halted H20 AI chip production for China amid security concerns and is pursuing a modified Blackwell design that could win regulatory approval; China remains a crucial market with estimates of substantial AI chip spending available this year (over $15B) if approvals come through.

- The stock remains highly favored by analysts, with a Strong Buy consensus and upside targets typically in the 11%–14% range (examples include targets around $199, $210, and $215).

- Data-center AI GPU demand is the growth engine, with Nvidia’s GPUs currently in tight supply and production capacity booked for the coming year; new GB300 and Blackwell Ultra initiatives are expected to support continued growth.

- Near-term earnings expectations are for a strong Q2 FY26 (EPS around $1.01 on about $45.9B revenue), with potential upside if guidance is raised; China-related revenue remains a risk factor that could temper gains.

- Valuation remains rich but justified by rapid growth: P/E in the high 40s, PEG near 1.3–1.4, and multiple analyst upgrades signaling confidence in Nvidia’s AI-led trajectory despite regulatory and geopolitical uncertainties.
