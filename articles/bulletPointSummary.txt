- Nvidia has secured exclusive access to TSMC’s next-generation A16 process node for its Feynman GPU architecture, with mass production around 2027 and use of SPR-backed nanosheet transistors, underscoring a key capacity edge in the AI hardware race.

- Nvidia expanded its strategic partnership with Synopsys and invested $2 billion in Synopsys common stock at $414.79 per share, aiming to integrate CUDA-accelerated computing with Synopsys’ design tools to accelerate engineering workflows and digital-twin simulations.

- Nvidia is positioning itself in the quantum computing ecosystem by working on ways to connect its chips to quantum units, as part of a broader industry push (IonQ’s expansion with partners like Skyloom Global and Oxford Ionics supports this momentum).

- Nvidia’s data-center business remains a major growth driver, with references to a $51 billion data-center quarter, highlighting strong AI infrastructure demand amid ongoing supply constraints in the AI hardware market.

- Wall Street remains bullish: Morgan Stanley raised Nvidia’s price target to $250 (Overweight) and cited confidence in a strong revenue trajectory, noting management signals and commentary (including GTC discussions) that support a higher outlook.
