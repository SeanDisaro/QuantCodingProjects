- Nvidia is a central driver of the AI boom, with CEO Jensen Huang signaling AI infrastructure spending could reach about $4 trillion by the end of the decade.  
- The stock carries a strong buy consensus with high price targets around $260–$264, implying roughly 44–46% upside over the next 12 months.  
- There are cautions about valuation and potential near-term pullbacks, with some top investors warning of a possible correction as AI spending normalizes.  
- China-export risk remains a factor: plans for H200 GPU shipments to China depend on regulatory approvals, with potential initial shipments and a ramp-up anticipated if greenlit (mid-2026 timelines cited).  
- Nvidia is a major contributor to the SMH semiconductor ETF’s strength, with SMH up strongly year-to-date and Nvidia helping drive an ETF upside around 21% (reflecting continued demand for Nvidia chips).
