- Nvidia and OpenAI announced a strategic partnership to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia-powered AI data-center compute, with Nvidia investing up to $100 billion; first phase targeted online in the second half of 2026 using the Vera Rubin platform.

- Analysts project a substantial long-term revenue impact from the OpenAI collaboration, with some estimates suggesting $300 billion to $500 billion in Nvidia revenue over time, and about $35 billion in revenue per 1 GW of compute.

- The stock remains broadly supported by analysts, with a Strong Buy consensus and price targets around $211.61 (implying roughly mid-teens to ~20% upside); other targets cited span roughly $200–$235.

- Real-world demand for Nvidia GPUs is evident, e.g., IREN’s $670 million GPU purchase (Nvidia and AMD) signaling robust AI cloud capacity expansion and demand for Nvidia hardware.

- The partnership raises strategic/competitive considerations, including Nvidia’s perceived crucial role for OpenAI (potentially as “investor of last resort”) and questions around accounting treatment, with implications for peers like Broadcom and AMD.
