- Nvidia posted blockbuster Q3 results: revenue of $57.01B (up 62% YoY) with data-center revenue of $51.2B; Q4 revenue guidance around $65B +/- 2%; gross margins targeted near 74.8–75%; AI demand remains strong for GB300/GB200 ramps.

- Analysts have raised price targets and growth expectations, with targets commonly in the $255–$275 range and some bulls pointing to $300+; upside estimates range roughly 30–40% or more, underpinned by Nvidia’s leadership in AI data-center acceleration.

- Market reaction has been mixed: the stock has faced a pullback after the rally, as investors weigh AI monetization risks and bubble concerns despite the strong fundamentals and guidance.

- The AI leadership thesis remains intact, with Nvidia viewed as the dominant supplier in data-center acceleration and the AI spending boom driving continued revenue growth and market share gains.

- Global AI infrastructure momentum is accelerating Nvidia GPU deployment through partnerships and large-scale deployments (e.g., AWS/Humain collaborations for up to 150,000 AI accelerators, a 500MW facility with xAI, and other regional AI-zone initiatives), reinforcing durable demand for Nvidia GPUs.
