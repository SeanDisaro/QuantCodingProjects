- NVIDIA announced DGX Spark, the world’s smallest AI supercomputer, delivering up to 1 petaflop of AI performance with 128GB of unified memory in a desktop form factor, enabling local inference for models up to 200 billion parameters and local fine-tuning up to 70 billion; shipping starts Oct 15 worldwide with OEM and partner channels.  

- DGX Spark is a full-stack solution that combines GPUs, CPUs, networking, CUDA libraries, and the NVIDIA AI software stack, powered by the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, NVIDIA ConnectX-7 200 Gb/s networking, and NVLink-C2C, delivering high bandwidth (5x PCIe) and preinstalled AI tools to start projects out of the box.  

- NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet, including Spectrum-X switches and SuperNICs, is designed for trillion-parameter AI workloads, enabling hyperscalers to interconnect millions of GPUs with unprecedented efficiency (about 95% data throughput versus roughly 60% for standard Ethernet) and is being deployed by Meta and Oracle in their AI data centers, with FBOSS integration.  

- Partnerships and infrastructure upgrades around Spectrum-X align with NVIDIA Rubin Ultra platforms and 800 VDC power architectures, as ABB accelerates development of 800 VDC systems for 1-megawatt server racks to support future AI data centers.  

- NVIDIA’s push into AI networking (Spectrum-X) is shaping the competitive landscape, contributing to negative sentiment for rivals like Arista Networks as Nvidia’s data-center networking advantage becomes more evident (e.g., Arista stock reacting to Nvidia’s Spectrum-X announcements).
