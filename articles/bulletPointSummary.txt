- Nvidia’s plan to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI is currently stalled and nonbinding, with Jensen Huang privately noting it was never finalized and signaling a reset rather than a breakup of the relationship.  
- Nvidia could still participate in OpenAI’s funding round via a direct equity stake rather than the large-scale construction plan, with Huang stating the company would invest “a great deal of money,” but not something like $100B.  
- OpenAI is raising up to $100B in private funding and has drawn interest from multiple partners; reports mention potential backers including Amazon and SoftBank, with Nvidia also positioned to be involved.  
- OpenAI has emphasized that Nvidia technology underpins its breakthroughs, and Nvidia is seen as central to scaling OpenAI’s systems, even as the deal structure remains in flux.  
- Market sentiment toward NVDA remains bullish: Strong Buy consensus with a current price target around $262.79 (about 37% upside), and individual analysts like Wedbush’s Matt Bryson assigning NVDA a $230 target (roughly 19.5% upside). NVDA stock reaction to the news has shown modest movements (e.g., about a 0.7% drop on the day).
