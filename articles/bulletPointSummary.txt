- Nvidia (NVDA) reported blockbuster results with Q3 revenue of $57 billion (up 62% YoY), gross margins above 73%, and guided to about $65 billion in next-quarter revenue, underscoring robust AI GPU demand.
- Wall Street remains highly bullish on NVDA, with a Strong Buy consensus (about 39 Buys, 1 Hold, 1 Sell) and average targets around $258.45, signaling roughly 42%–48% upside over the next year.
- Some investors worry the AI demand boom may not be endless and question the durability of Nvidia’s moat, citing Alphabet’s Gemini 3 and other potential competitive pressures that could temper growth.
- Regulatory and export dynamics add uncertainty: U.S. policy allows sale of H200 AI chips to China under a 25% tariff, creating a narrow window amid tight supply and ongoing China demand considerations.
- Nvidia’s AI ecosystem leadership and growth drivers remain intact, with opportunities from sovereign AI efforts and partnerships (e.g., OpenAI), ongoing Vera Rubin platform development for 2026, and sustained GPU demand contributing to continued upside despite rising memory costs.
