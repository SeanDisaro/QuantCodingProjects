- Wedbush analyst Dan Ives treats Nvidia’s recent pullback as a short-term dip and an opportunity to own a core AI winner, noting a demand-to-supply ratio of 10:1 for Nvidia’s chips and expecting Nvidia to drive the AI revolution.
- Ives says the AI boom is powering a tech rally and Nvidia is a central player, with the AI adoption wave just beginning to spread across more companies, potentially sustaining a multi-year bull cycle.
- Analysts broadly rate Nvidia as a Strong Buy alongside peers (MSFT, AVGO, MU), with price targets clustering in the high $190s to around $200s, signaling mid-teens upside from current levels.
- Regulators in China are moving to restrict sales of Nvidia’s China-specific AI processor H20, highlighting regulatory and geopolitical risks to Nvidia’s China business amid broader US-China tech tensions.
- Nvidia’s latest quarterly results show revenue of $44.06 billion and net profit of $18.78 billion; major firms maintain Buy ratings with targets around $200–$205, while insider sentiment turns negative with notable insider selling (e.g., Mark Stevens sold about 608,000 shares for around $88.35 million).
