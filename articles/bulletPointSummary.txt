- Bullish analyst stance across the board: multiple firms have raised NVDA price targets and reiterated Buy/Strong Buy ratings (e.g., Morgan Stanley $220, Wells Fargo $265, Evercore $261, Oppenheimer $265) with a consensus target around $240+, implying roughly 25–28% potential upside.

- Strong Q3 FY26 outlook: consensus expects about $1.25 EPS and roughly $54.7 billion in revenue, with industry checks indicating solid demand ahead of the print and Blackwell reaching full production alongside positive Vera Rubin signals.

- AI/data-center demand as the growth engine: NVDA’s AI data-center platform and GPUs remain a core driver, with expectations of rapid ramp as cloud providers invest in AI infrastructure; shipments/backlog data cited in notes underscore ongoing supply-demand momentum.

- Long-term strategic positioning and upside: beyond near-term results, Nvidia is viewed as building a broader AI/data-center platform with potential to extend into quantum computing through NVQLink and CUDA-Q, with bulls citing substantial long-run revenue opportunities (e.g., CEO comments on potential multi-hundred-billion-dollar scale by mid-decade).

- Risks and sentiment nuances: margin-debt growth and some insider selling are noted as risks, though they coexist with a prevailing Strong Buy consensus and upside expectations in the 25–28% range.
